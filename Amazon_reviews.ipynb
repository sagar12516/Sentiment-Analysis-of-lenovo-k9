frequently, mobile restarts whenever it feels like, phone bcoms hot while charging.. plzz dont buy it. best all round performance ever!! by purchasing this we have loosed by, rs.3000 within span of 30 days. no trust worthy deals from amazon. not worth it\\'s big disappointment from lenovo signal problems big headache problems with incoming calls and always show that you are not in range. best phone

with tv miracast and fast charging is take upto 2.15 hours contacts vcf files only download with google drive not by sd card total disappointed this is the device for average usage. battery could not last for a day. the biggest con of this phone is its battery. though it has 4000 mah battery, but it drains very fast. camera quality is good, not very good. specially, depth enabled mode, focus is not perfect. the thing i like most about this device is display. good india ka werorst mobile . battery fully charged offer 1 hour using 100 to 10 % . network signals full but incoming calls is out of coverage area.lenovo is cheating people. nice mobile. mobile is good in this range but battery backup not up to the mark, weight also very high.... good to have it at this price point improve in camera in new update slow mo added and no heating issue now but still need system updated. system updates are very slow superb excellent mobile phone very very good product and its really fast fast delivery... but mobile not worth rs.10000..no gestures, no latest features... heating issues... better choose other brands.. best mobile.great specifications .camera is too cleare focus is too sharp and fast thanks amazon and lenovo for such mobile.must buy guys verigood verigood.best firstly product not delivered on time dissatisfied 2 weeks.secondly android 7.1.1 naugat doesn\\'t have call recording optionthirdly when selling product cost was 13999/- now why drastically dropped. 10999/-fourthly when talking over the phone feels like nerve pulling to much radiation need immediate fix on this matter as it\\'s safety and security of customer.fifthly if any issues in hardware issues please let us know the service centers location. and please ensure hardware availability should be there at any time when customers booked.finally as discribed about product all features are ok no issues found as mentioned earlier if call recording option would have added the this product would have been met the expectations.camera quality is good not bad snap attached. excellent product nice & amazing the device restarts automatically..... bought this product recently from amazon. thoroughly dissatisfied with the phone. a thumbs down for this one. really killer hello all.. before you purchase remember battery performance of this device is very very poor. check the picture i attached. there was no use from 8 hours(sleeping) and i make sure data was off still see battery draining in idle mode. really bad performanc and this super turbo charger they calling is waste. its below thn average charger. really disappointed.i have just raised return request.pros : rest all good.cameradesignperformance etc to wrest phone is hang problem happy with the product ☺️🙂 very bad product.. lots of malfunction.. donot take this product the look and sleekness of this phone is good. but the features in this phone is very less as this phone doesn\\'t have the basic features like no sound controler option in shortcut shutter and most importantly there is no voice call recorder and the camera quality is also not good it is average in performance. third class phone, this time lenovo disappointed me, i have k3 and k4 note so bought k8 note without any kind of thinking and disappointed. it stucks anytime without any load to ram, battery is also third class defuces in very short time and turbo charge works sometimes but most of the time it works as normal charger.gallery and many othet apps aren\\'t available as it has stock android, best thing is it often shows that process.android.com stopped workingwhat the .. ok with the product, but the problem was it gets shut down while charging i love lenovo k8 note handset but i replace 3 times turbo charger in allahabad service centre within 6 month it becomes turbo charging to slow charging plz lenovo fix it, i request u really good to buy great features.. gift raping is very poorwords also very small (please refund money for that work) i personally don\\'t recommend to buy this product if anyone want to connect tv over cast screen option. option is available but not compatible with any other device other than chromecast for casting, though it was available for other model of lenovo phone. good if you are looking for a mid range phone u can go for this, features are pretty good but some small problems arises now and then, if ignored then worth the money as sim slot was not working i returned and got fast delivery too so giving 5 star bcz i m lenovo fan and i just love mobile the best mobile of this year. it get hot in less time but i guess we ca. ignore it bcz the phone is v.good and with lots of good features and killer look too. worst for gaming and music.. i bought this for the deca core processor it has but it works worse than a quad core processed phone. and it said it has 2 speakers but one of them (left) doesn\\'t have a speaker just holes to cheat buyers. decent camera and display. battery could be made better. and the ram keeps on working for 50 - 60% even while the phone is not in use. really awsome there is heating and battery backup problem nice phone .... product is good. purchased on sep-17 and got cash back on 25dec17. what a way to make fool, they called it cash back.lol nice mobile mobile is good .but heating problem is one thing that..effecting it\\'s popularity. in this segment it\\'s very good productcamera is also greatsound is greatover all superb mobile in good working process more than expect but charger have big drawback it\\'s not a turbo charger very late charging the mobile worst experience from lenovo. previously i bought k5 note and got mic problems. and now i m facing battery problem, camera problems. plz dont buy lenovo phones. great phone nice.. good,...,.........mo like it high expectation hurts 😪... dual camera is not upto the mark..... apart from that no issues at all..... 4g+4g logic needs to be made clear.... i bought the lenovo k 8 on the first sales day.but very much disappointed with the dolby atmos feature on the lenovo k 8.it does not sound good at all. when switch on also it sound so weak and not punching at all when i compare it with a lenovo k6 .can i get a sofwares updates to make it sound good?or is it that i got a defective phone?please let me know at the earliest? it\\'s battery is draining very fast. back camera images not so good.a yellow shadow occurred functions of the phone are not good. performance is also wrost. total waste of money. please don\\'t buy this phone. what ever they are showing in their add is false. please go for mi or any other brand which give very good mobile at this range. nice product the worst phone i bought again from the lenovo. before i though with stock android it will perform good but the same story battery drain in idle time. dual camera is a joke. and still no fix update as lenovo known for it. please do not buy it. very good good mobile, heating problem but its normal bad quality phn is gud n nice.but the battery is draining too fast.battery is not 4000mah too bad nice some time display is not working prpperly major disadvantage of this model is battery is not detachable..except that all features and working so nice battery backup is very good i am using lenovo k8 note (4gb, 64gb) model xt1902-3 type m2cb2 since last ten days. i am not fully satisfied with this product because i found one problem. amazon described in the product description that this handset has both sim slots with 4g enabled. but it is found that slot 1 support 4g whereas slot 2 supports only 3g, not 4g. it\\'s just a okay phone.no such effects of dual cameras. not a dual 4g support one sim slot is 3g that is disadvantage, otherwise awesome features are really good but, some backlogs1. though it has 4gb ram sometimes mobiles struck and delay in responding.2. 4000mah battery runs out quickly like 3100 mah.3. delay in camera operating response.4. delay in contact searching. it\\'s irritating when we search for a contact and getting more time to save a contact.5. very worst mobile in this range.friends pls don\\'t buy it. go for some better mobile..i swear u will regret after you use it. very bad camera. front camera good but sound need to improve amazing product in reasonable price range. not expected at all. left speaker channel is false, only right speaker working. camera is avarage. double tap wakeup is not working properly. earphone sound quality is not better ( using jbl). not satisfied. poor camera not a good product... the product is awesome great phone hang hota hai phone great phone with excellent connectivity. quick charging and excellent talk time due to the large battery. the twin camera requires steadier hands than mine. ota update to android 8.0. but the bluetooth connection on this phone is intermittent and unstable.supplementary information: the claimed gorilla glass 3 screen is probably ordinary glass as it cracked as the phone slipped from my grasp while sitting on a sofa. lenovo says the screen is not covered. reducing rating to two stars. fast delivery. delivery is to be provided for all districts. good phone. feels a bit heavy. notification sounds can\\'t be adjusted, is a bit annoying. photos takes a lot more memory but not as much clarity for that memory. other features are good. i want return it me bodru using lenovo k8 note from 29th august.this mobile\\'s performance so good.but it\\'s battery does note perform as another 4000mhz battery mobile.so plz check it and try to solve it. very poor batterybattery drain within 8 hrsit\\'s doesn\\'t show the 4000 mah performance it is good 😎😎 smooth !! not too good , configuration is high but auto deduced when calling or listing due to auto touch to screen so huge problem is purchased on 22 nd jan 2018. average phone at this price segment.though the cameras are supposed to be high performance but not satisfied.battery charged quickly and lasts for a full day only.lookswise ok, lenovo again a name you can trust upon.but don\\'t buy with too much expectations, simply an average smart phone and off course good for rough use. not expected about the k8 performance is that much,i\\'m really happy about the product in all specifications,and the thanks to amazon for given me good and non damaged product in time. the best phone in terms of specifications, audio sound, battery, screen,camera, ram, rom alongwith corning gorilla glass. all the best things in a mobile without burning ur pocket. lacks some apps like pc connection etc. good phone after update it\\'s good not a good phone.. in only 2.5 month it started hanging with more than 25 gb available memory in the phone. camera is not also good. now lenovo have to seriously think about the performance of their mid range phones. ye amazon wale both b.c hai .. phn kharida lenovo k8 note usme game ka hanging issue hai.. b.c replace k ly bolte hai par behanchod layla dete hai... bhosdi ke pese jane ke bad service bhi nai dete inka technician bhosdi ka game khelke kenya hai koi problem nai hai .. in behanchod me copy phone bhej diya much mat kaharidna.. amazon se .. bhot bhosdi wale hai... volte calls & sms not coming in when the phone is in standby mode.. all things are good about this phone.smoothly running and no problem till now this phone is goodbut camera is not so good as 13mp...over all it\\'s good phone heating problem during charging worst depth effect honestly if you want to buy a phone with depth effect then go for mi a1 but this is not for youif you are a selfie holic then i recommend you to buy this phone bcz the selfie here is literally good as compare to other phones in this price range this phone is on top in terms of selfiein terms of processor i\\'ll say that snapdragon 625 is much better then this bcz this phone will not save your battery as redmi phones does and this processor is built on 20 nm technology and snapdragon 625 is on 14 nm that\\'s 625 is battery efficient but lenovo is providing you fast charger which is about 15w so don\\'t worry you can get your day battery in just 1 hr. if you plug your phone on 20% then it will get charge 70 to 80% in just 1 hr. which can last upto 8 hrs.on minimal usage so if you really want to buy this one i\\'ll recommend you to buy this but keep in mind some cons of this phone when you\\'re buying it. its an excellent phone.......but sometimes heating problem may occur.overall phone is very good in every condition.camera quality, processor, turbo charging and many more fabulous features. good mobile nice parfomce really good product 👌👌👌 good one of the best mobiles in recent days no record facilities.no adequate instructions to use it\\'s can\\'t compete with redme note 4

ordered a venom black variant & received gold variant.its so pathetic. i am going to return the phone. very good very good. battery performance and charging time is really bad and worst good phone, smoothly work touchscreen great features under 15k rs. i\\'m totally satisfied with it amazing performance worth the money...amazing service by amazon. worthy purchase....using from approx last 4 months..handy & smooth touch.. perfect product...100% happy...thanks. product is worst , even amazon and lenovo is not supporting properly if there is an issue one of the worst phone i purchased. phone has some serious os issues, but technician could not able to crack it. amazon is not ready to refund the amount. they are cheating. please do not buy. don\\'t go for amazon too. very bad .i got defected piece . headphone jack and hotspot not working. poor battery and a lot of heating even for normal usage. i\\'ll prefer moto g5 compare to this. when i dubble tap on image that can\\'t zoom. why ? in this phone don\\'t have gallery opetion or menu fix this problem as soon as after using for a month found 2 issues which annoying for me : 1) call recorder only records one side voice because of stock android, 2) network reception is poor compared other devices, not getting proper network for any of the network service provider, flactuating and sometimes goes down to zero,i have raised the complaint for any possible solution on lenovo forum, but haven\\'t got anything yet and don\\'t think got anything in future also very poor sound quality. asome phone the worst products i have ever buy. too much heating , battery drains up very very quickly, issues with mic , most of the time calls inaudible, please don\\'t buy it. express delivery very nice lenovo k8 note. no problem when connecting to pc/laptop. battery backup is very good. both cameras are very good quality. good nice phone with great features at this price. but only problem is my phone gets off anytime without any reason. complained to amazon for exchange. waiting for amazon\\'s response. very gud phone excellent resolution and camera is supurb but i\\'m having some battery and heating issues.. need a invoice good mobile a reasonable price better choice.... awesome camera & also performance... worse product from lenovo upto now . no proper singal , network issue is big problem . poor singnal quality on all operators. which effect calls , internet speed all . nice mobile so good most disgusting phone ever. heating issues, bad camera, low battery level. battery heats so much that i am afraid that it may burst. i am planing to throw this mobile. its a threat to life.bad service by amazon also. earlier those people said phone would be return according to return policy. but they gave wrong information. they are asking me to go to lenovo customer care and get it verified even if it is faulty even being in returnable period. this is really disappointing. i strongly recommend people not to buy this garbage from this site. this lenovo k8 was fine for two days subsequently it takes more than 8 hrs to charge inspite of rapid charger - i have been to thier auth service center in vain as they are not aware of the product & solution - i had given k5 for service under warranty it\\'s still lying with them for more than 17 days, this became defective for using google navigation got over heated & switch off - this makes me rethink about lenovo products through amazon sale good the phone is awesome! a must buy product! value for money product! ignore some small drawbacks .... nice in coming sounds are not working apple se best features not up to the mark never boots up, since last night it showing lenovo logo powered by android,. sad product,it is really bad experience nice smart phoen firstly i ordered it but got a defective peice and it was like a hell to meagain by replacing it i got a good peiceand now it meant all my requirementsgood speedgood cameragreat speed no hangingloved it my invoice bill is not given.i m in a fix bhangar phone i bought it before some day and it is nice phone with some demerits which u must to know that according to my views and uses it\\'s screen is not actually gorilla glass.it is easily brokenable and phone thickness is much more than usual phones. product is ok it\\'s my second mobile in one month but heating problem is main issue to much heat when charging and net using....raj mishra7383506358 not bad awesome budget phone competeting with mi note series... sound is good,turbo charging is just a marketing gimmickcamera is just average..samsung camera quality in the same price range is much better only one speaker given & sound quality bad good phone at this pricebut still work on turbo charging it takes nearly 4hrs to 5hrs to get fully charged nice worth money.. super there is no super cast feature, my old mob lenovo k3 note is itself as this feature. without casting i dont like this, unable to connect to smart tv no...it is getting draining battery very fastly....and some apps are crashed...i does not like this product..try to improve battery performance am requesting lenovo worst phone everor the worst android version everbattery drains in 2 hrs from 100-10never buy this phone or any phone having android 7.1 i am a movie lover. wanted to watch them on my big tv screen by casting them from my new k8 note. i have an android tv box - not chrome castthere is a option in phone to cast under display,but disappointingly the phone could not find the tv.to me this a major draw back. it may not be a serious issue for those who do not use mirroring.worst thing was when i wanted a solution from lenovo team through live chat, the person who was chatting, one mr saleem says k8 can cast only through chrome cast.further when i was typing my next question, he abruptly disconnected.there are also lot many posts by several users complaining about the casting issue on k8 note. nice phone. best specifications. it\\'s very nice product and i use the phone and i very happy satisfied with the product very good phone in this range...... not good as samsung quality products, earphone should be given with the phone. phone is good, doesn\\'t lag but battery backup is not up to a expectation level...overall a nice phone , got 2000 off during diwali plus additional cash back by paying through debit card nice phone for the price. casting not working even after sw update.camera is avg and slow. no headphones in the box. awesome mobail ,but battery is too poor good the phone\\'s wonderful but the box which reached me did not contain any earphone.worst delivery the delivery was fast but they didn\\'t given invoice this is bad the mobile is good battery backup is moderate and volume in headphones is a bit low flash light not working , default write disk not available , good build good phone but rear camera is not so good and dolby atmos is not working. actually bug in lenovo os best phone of 2017 mobile is good. but the charger is not the turbo charger very nice phone,no problem yet.. nice phone looking smart. excellent affordable very good looking stylist but sometimes network problem found. a good product by lenovo and delivery was great by amazon. dual camera may be much better, but its depth enabled mode needs more improvement. overall the performance of phone is good. pros are more here than cons .. very bad network connection every day network problem.... draining battery fast.... heating when the phone is plugged into charge in off mode... network issues in calling using jio... processor performance is also not good.. i bought this phone for my friendhe is pretty happy with the phoneall the specs meet his daily basic requirementsbuta highly skinned os makes it little fullotherwise a great tech battery is poor. again disappointed with lenevo. can\\'t work whole day with so called 4000mah. lenevo should work on this and camera part also which is poor empty box.product missing excellent!! nice phone it doesn\\'t connect to my samsung level u bluetooth headset. even it just don\\'t finds while searching. great product...no defects...worth the price...the delivery guy even opened the void seal in front of me... i always trusted amazon..but this time they gave me defected piece. my phone gets heated everytime and the battery goes down very quickly. m so pissed of by this, it has been only two days and i am experiencing this nice phone,fast, good battery backup and good camera clearity nice phone very nice features i love to use this phone very nice not upto mark especially camera sound quality is not good and also no gallery to store images.. need to download for play store..rest everything is perfect. good phone over all good phone... a little bit of heating while charging which i think is normal as turbo charge.... else no heating problem... a nice looking device... camera quality is not as expected....battery backup is good.. after playing games and spend good online on airtel 4g network.. i charge the battery to 100% in morning time and at the end of the day i am ending up with 40-45% battery remaining..... a better product in this price range. nice i found everything what expected except headphone. the fone is overall good. but there are issues with network connections especially while using volte on jio. totally waste it was good but in this heating is main disadvantage but everything is good amazing no contacts in phone everything to be stored to google, in bigger font size, the display ia going out of screen, the signal indicator ia never full....not a great phone compared to its predecessors i had purchased on 08/10/2017 after using more than 15 days found that device fault of software mobile getting hang and restart automatically .same issue consulting with lenovo customer care as per there technical solutions till problem not solved.after that i was visited lenovo care mapusa goa as per there technical expertise need of software upgrade after software updated till issue not resolved. after this there technical expertise person said need of change of mother board .i have questions about lenovo product that mobile not having any physical and water dimage then how could possible mother board probleam and in goa there is no any lenovo care centre in margao and panjim it\\'s near about 50 km from margao. so weast of my valuable time which is more cost than my money and also weast of my money . please do not go for this product. bad service faulty products. this phone is very good...i like this phone got the phone delivered on time . that is the only good thing in this entire experience of mine . (updated now) a new update , the first update didn\\'t provide any noticeable difference but this one\\'s log looks promising, let\\'s see..i have been using various models of mobiles , have never seen such a terrible device , . bought this after much thoughts by trusting the name lenevo .i have been using redmi note 4 & it never had any issues with battery or even camera . listening to music through youtube , browsing, facebook , insta , still solid backup for more than a dayi have 4 other phones also , moto g3 & samsung s3 , htc 628g , samsung j7 prime .this phone(lenevo k8) seems to be worst among all.1)battery : has left me shattered with its worst battery life , have just used to take some pictures , youtube & songs , it goes down very fast . (yet to enter two sim card & use whatsapp , gmail , so if it continues to become more worst i\\'d surely update & escalate this )2),camera quality(for a dual camera , it is nowhere near honor 6x which is 1k lesser) .if you are tricked by the dual camera ( it still has not got update of slowmo , time lapse ) but it is really good when taken in professional mode with manual iso & focussing.a disaster in auto mode , that too for a rear camera with dual lens .i wish the company wakes up and starts rolling out ota update for camera & battery life improvement.other than that , the phone is super smooth , display , touch , finger print sensor & stock android is a bit of self satisfaction that i can say to myself for wasting 14k .i thought of gifting it to my father , but this would make it surely an incomplete gift .!wish the company looks into these issues & provides updates for the camera & battery life because that is what it was paid for & marketed by the company claiming those 2 are the highlight factors.lost interest to even post pictures of it.with much regret. it was launched as the next big thing in budget smartphones and claimed to have the best camera in that range.phone is ok.decent battery life, not the best but still a decent camera.after 4-5 months of use i found it starts to hang a bit but i guess that’s normal with low budget android devices. not very great phone. it says it has turbo charge but it takes four hour to reach 100%. not worth buying very bad mobile don\\'t buy it... 4000mah battery, but doesn\\'t work as......low battery backupoverall 4* but for battery 2* ok lenovo k8 note heating over some times yes or no ? don\\'t buy this product from amazon. when i bought the product it was scratched. keep these thing: it is a radiation phone. i can use this phone of 10min and feels headache. i contacted the amazon many times. they will not help you. don\\'t buy this phone spending this much money. service from amazon is also very poor. very good battery backup, nice camera. doulby system sound very nice. budget phone very good. nice experience. battery backup, both camera are very good. speed is also nice and its charging is very fast. awesome battery backup ,awesome camera,great audio and video experiencetotally a killer note till date great phone.... buy only if you can compromise with the cameras.... cos they are not good at all good camera not good and dual sim has issues randomly if jio used.calls not receiving at times even though full signal bettry is very very poor..and phone is getting hot sir ,iam akash adagond ,all is well but it has curved on screen display so when i attach a tampered glass the air gap present surround the screen ,plz tell where i purchased a tampered glass sufficient to this mobile ,or send me that ,i will pay the bill pls pls pls pls pls one month back i am purcsaesd lenovo k8 mobile.now i am facing charging problem...... now it takes almost 4 hour to full charge... i am not satisfied with this phone..though it has lots of good features..i have faced several times hanging issue, i have lodged complain to amazon..but ...nothing happened.. it worked fine for first 7 days. afterwords touch is not working properly. some times touch doesn\\'t respond, after few mins screen keep flickering multiple times, without even touching it. had horrible experience with this phone. i want to return this product. very nice product very good lots of issues, os is truble. do not buy this item, returning policy is not working, do,t buy on amazon bad decision of buying this phone... firstly it was not up to the mark....as it\\'s specifications are mentioned....the 1st mobile was replaced within 7 working days....after that they replaced it with a new one....the new phone worked properly (though not 100%) for the next 5 months...then suddenly got dead...and now i can\\'t even switch it on....poor quality phone from lenovo....no other option but to wait at the service center to get it repaired👎👎. camera and it\\'s performance is nice but battery backup is very poor not fast chargingcharging time 8 hrs i request you all please don\\'t buy this product.phone is heated up always.turbo charger performance is poor.phone performance also bad. awesome phone with cool performance.money\\'s worth mobile phone.prospicture qualitydolby atmosbatteryprocessormusic keystock androidfast chargecons:dual camerano custom uiheating issue while in charge my goodness..nvr thought abt it, mobile auto restart issue from the very next week, battery draining fast, application crash, charging issue, voice issue..from the 10th day of purchase i m facing all these issues.. very nice look mobile kuch khas nahi very bad interface, screen does not turnoff when receiving a call, app start and stop working at their own will. very poor network reception, volte feature turns off automatically need to restart or go offline & online for the feature to come back. camera is only think that is okay about the phone good i using it till 5 months its superb..... i want invoice lenovo could not assure you of separating themselves from their relationship with heating issues.. a phone though is spectaluar at the price but lags in bokeh effect. nice one... bt battery is not so good. it\\'s a awesome phone in lowest price.. body is very heatingbattery usage is suddenly decrease after using few weeks i can say this phone has met all my expectations and i am completely satisfied with it, specially with camera and it’s effects, battery is up to the mark, dolby speakers works really good ,no issues with memory, supports 4g on both sim cards, wifi connectivity is also good...however there is some issue related to cell phone networks, specially during roaming areas, i could say there is small lack in the network chipset due to which sometimes it puts you in a situation where it’s doesnt shows you any kind of signal whereas other phones could get the network very easily.overall performance is really good and satisfactory.apart from this i haven’t received my jet previledge bonus points which i supposed to get for this order.thanks from the begining it\\'s google not responding.sometime it gives the feelings that i bought a second hand mobile. gud buy for people looking for budget oriented smartphone.happy tht lenovo has improved its camera. i am very irritating with this phon. i bought this phone in amazon on 8th sep. my phone having software issue. when i am install new app in my phone it was installed but i can not see on my phone. if am rebooting phone then app will be show on screen and then i can use it. this i am facing issue. try to solve this problem or suggest me what can i do now. am also contacted with customer service center also they can reinstall os but problem not solved. worst phone i have ever taken lenovo is fck product ...killer note total killer... value for money.got before time delivery.excelent performance.. bestest smartphone not up to mark.processor is very slow and the operating system is also not user friendly don\\'t buy lenovo phones....it\\'s the worst bet for your money. have had enough bad experiences with the k3note dabba mobile..pls dnt take dis..i thought 13mp cam is vry god wit d picture & selfie bt it\\'s nt expected..it\\'s vry poor & lenovo k6 power is better dan dis.. no head phone in the package nice pricing and nice features. value for money awesome mobile battery and camera are best in class. over heating when we use volte and battery draining very fast otherwise phone is ok too good good product . satisfied price very poor in quality after using 3 days the phone is dead now chargre not working performance of camera (front & rear) is worst. it doesn’t illuminate properly & adequately. picture quality & images are very poor, worst, low illuminating, irritating, strains the eyes. even the full brightness is dull & worst. good but slitly need to improve the depth mode in camera. camera is not good super phone very good product & amazon good service just buy it i owned lenovo k4 note before this.there is no problem for even 2 years.but this k8 note is a worst phone that i ever used.i faced many problems in my first day of using this phone.dolby sucks!screen flickering!low sound via earphones!please ignore models which came after k4 note!i am going to return this crap. very good product...fast delivery by amazon.. this phone was all awesome for me at the given price, except for one big flaw! it boasts to have a battery of 4000 mah. but i have to charge it twice a day. the phone loses 85% of charge within 12-14 hours of normal use*.*by normal use, i mean keeping the 4g data on. 20-30 mins of call. no gaming. some time hanging problem and battery problem please call me amazing speed, fluid touch experience, app installation time is great, charging speed is really good, full charge in just 2 hour, battery backup is good with full day uses. camera quality is really good, love this phone phone was very good.. in case of performance...but depth effect was not proper... simply waste.the case cover they gave was damaged... apart from this everything was fine .very good product lenovo k8 not, near me, thank you heating up while using mobile is fast, camera is good but only one speaker is working, did not expect this from a company like lenovo, want to return/exchange. a must buy smartphone in the middle range.... really loving it...... good work fine outstanding better than mi and redmi all features is outstanding camera is awesome mobile heated very bad product mobile heating problem,charging very slow. every thing is fine apart from battery backup. just loved it , it\\'s around 2-3 weeks that i am using this phone and there is no issue . let see how it works in the long run . good performance the mobile is good starting i faced some heating and charging problems but after the update it\\'s working well and all camera ,heating etc all problems was solved and i\\'m typing review from this phone very good and worth it.. nice so nice on average mobile not good not satisfied with the phone, since volte not working, misguided by amazon as well as lenovo saying that it is a volte phone. whenever wifi starts call disconnect. even lenovo not responding needs frequent charging and call drop problem. very bad product.only hardware is good but software has many defects.user interface system is not good.conference call,call waiting not working.auto brightness is malfunctioning,auto focus not good.there is no option for multiple delete contact,contact management functions lack,there is less option of modification & gesture.lack of customer support of lenovo. at the time of charging it becoming hot. great combination....but dual camera is not that much effective. awesome phone really good... get hot after 5-10 minute of gameplay or internet usage... unacceptably hot. worst phone ..lost my money on this phone. do not waste your hard earned money . they would t even return this item amazon should at least give replacement , but no options... i feel cheated. i doesn\\'t got any cash back of 10% on using sbi debit card my brother liked it very much. he is happy with the mobile and its features. thanks lenovo and thanks amazon. best smartphone in this price segment. ...such a great feature. .... awesome phone in such a price good one pathetic phone. here is why this one is a flop show. dont even think of buying this so called phone. even a brick is better1) takes 3 hours to fully charge. sometimes charges in half an hour. once i was stuck at 43 percent for nearly 10 mins2) phone doesnt allow you to answer a call sometimes. the screen just freezes3) doesnt latch on to network properly. you get lots of missed calls alerts4) some apps such as trucaller dont work wellthis is the last lennovo device i ever buy... battery drains very fast when im using continuously . the battery drains from 100% to 0% within 4 hrs , being the battery 4000 mah swipe to unlock, unlocks the phone with out even asking password. mobile is not working its the best phone i ve ever used since i am born nice phone at this price range.....deca core processor was awesome it loads games quickly.....i received an update for slow motion recording...hope receive an update for 4 k tecording.....only drawback is the camera quality is lower than redmi note 4 and moto g5s plus....this phone doesn\\'t sense the natura color of images properly than it\\'s competitors.... battery life is average don\\'t expect too much life as 4000 mah....i hope lenovo might solve this probs through update....my rating was 3.7 not satisfied..over heating this is really an awesome mobile phone. mobile is good but not received proper bill and there is no emi no mentioned on bill phone is good but features is not well old features and functions in this phone everything is excellent..and excellent features.but lens used in camera are poor qualitywhen image is zooming ...it will show lot of noise...better ..if they will update camera feature.. too much heating problem almost feels like burning my ear while talking...no turbo charging lenovo and amazon are just fooling and looting our money..please don\\'t buy this product.. i want invoice for mobile(variant). awesome...just updated to oreo.. i want my mobile invoice by mail very worst back camera front was perfect and battery was not to be expected level flas light is also not good bhul se mat lena koi bhi ye mobile..battery backup bilkul kharab hai..agar kahi bahar nikle to 2se 3 ghanta me battery low ho jayega great mobile with deca core and good ram good price good phone if you have this than you become photographer few cons to consider:this product heats a lot during gaming,gps navigation,camera and charging.switch off -switch on time (reboot) time s bit more. nice .but if you can afford 2000 extra than you should go for moto g5s plus bad experience ever not expect from lenovothis phone has hardware issue and heating problem, as well as batterylow backup turbocharger takes1and half hour to chargewrost experience ever good mobil this phone has whatever i need, plus it\\'s in budget. usb data cable is not working device is getting heated with any application usage for more than 5 mins this device running smoothly for 2.5 monthsafter that hanging problem eg then data is book can\\'t open very slowly change and many more problems in this device. i\\'m loving it so far........great specs, awesome performance,the best in its price range for surethe only complaint if any is that it uses only one of it\\'s dual cameras for normal photos and so takes like 3 seconds to focus on a page very amazing phone in this price bad phone awsome all of sudden phone\\'s sim slot isn\\'t working.i think it\\'s a hardware problem.kindly fix it as soon as possible.. excellent mobilecamera clarity superb front & back 4.8**display clarity fine 4.5**battery ok 4.2**signal issue is very high 3.5**os speed ok4.5**better than mi note 4overall parformence is good budget phone. average battery. fast charger saved the show. front camera is good. rear camera in normal mode is good but struggles in depth enabled mode. dual sim plus dedicated memory slot is added advantage. a bit of android glitches were observed but nothing to worry. looks are good. venom black colour is quite impressive. this phone is amazing, it\\'s camera is too good, perfect for selfi.. got scratch in gorilla glass after 10 days use.can i get replacement? it is really a nice phone. nyc product phone is nice but i think mi y1 is best. price difference also big between them. camera decent, perfomance good, heating issue, battery backup not good worst phone i have ever seen battery not comes even half a day i have called several times to amazon to return the phone but their response also worst than this phone after around 3 months i finally came to a conclusion that this phone is average in all fields. battery last for around 1 day of moderate usage after an overnight charge. heating issues facing since the day i bought it. gaming performance is good.i have tried all types of games including gta san andreas and nova 3. there are no lags in the performance, the mediatek processor produce enough juice to pump the phone. i liked the selfie camera more than the primary one as the bokeh effect is crap and the single camera is also not good enough and here comes the major problem i\\'m having whenever any song is played on bluetooth connected speaker and the data is on the musoc starts distorting. overall an average phone. i think there\\'s more out there in this price range but it\\'s not a complete failure. regretting after buying. camera performance are not good i been using it for last 4 days. and the phone is actually a killer. that being said by lenovo \"killer\" i hope that the phone doesn\\'t really kills me. cause the only thing that is bothering me is this heating issue while charging. awesome performance good clarity awesome features awesome phone in this price it\\'s been almost more than 2 weeks that i am using this phone and have not faced a single issue. it\\'s worth every penny. sturdy built, good hold, awesome touch, loud speaker, super battery backup, good rear and front cameras and top it all stock android. go for it. my phone is good condition very nice good phone over heating while using net. not bad this is good phone with awesome battery backup and camera clarity. worst product at this price lack of features as compared to other lenovo product better go for redmi don\\'t buy this good phone i\\'m happy with this this lenovo k8 note issues are given below ?1. 4g volte & 4g lte network not supporting2. if u want to set phone ring tone (music). then u have to down load es file explore. good but slow after using 3/4 month nice product not bad nice phone i don\\'t like this phone dual camera is totally garbage and battery also not working well....deca core processor ke baad me bhi real maja nahi aa raha battery without use hi discharge ho rahi hai contacts sim or phone me save nhi horhe,,dollby atmos kuch kaam ka nahi hai isse achha toh kisi normal phone me jet audio plus download krdlo headphone jack ki sound bahut kam hai sometimes new installed app was don\\'t show phone ko restart krna padta hai so i don\\'t like this lenovo k8 note... great specifications and big screen in this price is value for money. i think the camera quality could have been better having dual camera. almost moto like interface does not make it something different. works fine. product damaged , display not working properly , blinking issue , camera quality is worst phone stopped working after 2 weeks of purchase and very bad service centre.lenovo k8 note the \"worst phone of 2017\" good performancebutlow quality of gorilla glassbut glass camed cracked awesome phone...no lag, camera is average but with lil effort you can pull fine quality images. nice that\\'s for very heating i note setsfid very best phone this range just need more battery backup its very poor battery

mobile dont buy even from amazome they did not take it back it doesn\\'t have any tracking facility to track own mobile location. if mobile lost you can\\'t find like samsung and apple does. very good phone and value for money that glass is not aa scratch proof by putting a small stone it has aa line on glassbut it was nice phone all goods i like it.but tag line \"lenovo k8 note (venom black, 4gb) with new system update\" doesn\\'t match. since i had purchase my phone my os didnt update to oero. so i m little bit dis- appointing . as i had mail to lenovo customer care also but didnt got any

the venom black color as it looks more stylish than the gold one. the battery back up of the phone is great. camera is far too awesome. the screen itself is a masterpiece very sleek. no heating problem so far.best phone in the range.you won\\'t regret buying it. 😊 phone is good but there are no headset provided with it and also there is no screen guard comes with it.this phone\\'s battery capacity is 4000mah but it doesn\\'t look like this because it hardly run for a whole day. really satisfied with 3-4 days of use..battery life is good..stock android is just flawless..simple n smooththanks lenovo :) never by this phone battery performance medium.camera medium. good phone but not excellent. its a really nice phone and camera is very nice awesome phone and service i have purchased 3 lenovo mobile in past 1 year. but lenovo quality going to decreasing day by day. recently i have purchased new lenovo k8 note on 8 feb 2018 and its start over heating after 20 days. and now its battery start drains quicker. now my mobile is switch off and i relay don\\'t want to use it again even i will never use lenovo mobile again. my rating is -5 for this product. for someone almost a average phone , the dual rear camera is not so good . suggested not to buy this in 2017 end and in 2018 . go for better redmi or another brands . super mobile good product n sounds also so good charge stand by for 2 days... camera is super... more than 3 mths i\\'m using tis mobile lovely mobile from lenovo n best price from amazon... so thankful for such good product for amazon... planning to shop more n more from amazon oly... ❤️😄😍 good phone. using it from past 3 weeks. no issues. worth the money. go for it blindfolded. dont worry about the helios processor, it is good and no heating issues noticed while gaming. excellent... nice phone value for money.. battery drain issue after oreo update. charging time 5 to 6 hours . drain time 3 to 4 hours .worst customer support gorilla 3 just a name only. brought this phone on march 2018 and screen didn\\'t last 4 months also got cracked after falling from few meters.can anyone please give me the link for original genuine screen replacement lcd folder with the same curve and display brightness. supar phone to begin with, considering the price range i never had lot of expectations from this phone. now that i have received it and used it for over 24 hours.. i would rate my experience as good!the touch of the phone is very good, soft and feels premium.battery life is good however it does not show battery percentage on the main screen.camera comes under average performance. the depth mode doesn\\'t really serves the purpose here. honor 6x has better camera than k8performance of the phone is good.so overall, this is a good phone and when it comes to camera it\\'s closest rival- honor 6x takes the lead. its been only 1 month and it started giving trouble....its overheating and taking more hours for charging and giving less battery backup mobile is very good but it has heating issue.. screen is not antiscratchscratch occurs in my mobile when it fall downbad gorilla glassscreen quality is not good worst battery backup, comes for only 6 hrs. depth focussing camera is not effective as expected. other features are good. nice mobile cpu is very best. i love it. lenovo hyped this phone for it\\'s dual rear camera and a deca core mediatek processor and believe me these are the most worst things in this phone.camera - the dual rear camera is of no use, it gives a fake bokeh effect. in depth enabled mode the camera struggles to focus. you will find the edges of the object are blurred along with the background. without depth enabled mode both front and back cameras are just average.processor & battery - the mediatek helio x23 processor is good in performance but since it is clocked at 2.3 ghz, the gets heated even on normal uses or while while charging. it aslo consumes the battery very fast, the 4000 mah battery will hardly last for 1 day on normal uses.sound clarity - nice sound clarity on speaker as well as earphone. thanks to dolby atmos.display - screen clarity is good.ui - its a user choice, i am not a stock android fan as it lacks many features comes with custom roms like miui. otherwise there is no problems with ui, it runs pretty smooth.final verdict - its just a average phone, there are many other good options available in market at same price point. if you are camera lover and want a good camera phone then go for honor 6x, if you want good performance then go for redmi note 4 and if you want good performance with stock android then buy a moto g5+ very poor graphics user friendly bekar ha .....mat lo good product received phone but no headphone inside the pack although in limited warranty booklet there is a warranty of 3 months for earphone phone is not good. bettery and charging problem occurred after 3 to 4 month. no response from service center. i\\'m security fingerprint and pattern no working charging very slow great phone with nice specs. till now had no problems. good product charging problem & camera mistake worst product poor quality camera, battery draining fast and over heating on simple use charger not working... mobile is fine..amazon service very bad... perfect selfie phone it gets very hot while using. i was using lenovo k4 for last one year and was more satisfied with that rather this one @ 13999. main drawback of this phone arebeautiful_ cast (screen mirror) doesn\\'t work. bluetooth is also disturbing. touch screen is not as sensitive as it should be with 4gb ram and 64 gb internal memory with 10 core processer. display got broken very early with in two months of use. it\\'s very normal and not as strong as k4. hand grip is not good. voice clarity not good and dolby sound is just normal and speakers are very normal and sound is low. k4 was much better in this regard. call logs and call recording another big drawback of this phone. i will not recommend this phone for purchase even @ the cost of 10k. not too good all good but fingerprint sensor not working sometime.. getting heat up very soon not satisfactory.while you will try to return,it will tell somany steps.but you can\\'t return.and from last months order till now no return of money back of sbi card. good but not best battery drains and earphone connector issue nice mobile phone is very heavy and camera is not good not even equal to 8mp. better go for honor 6x instead of this. excellent and superb phone. superb product. few of the feature are awesome. duel camera, front 13mp camera, back and front flash, dedicated music button, dedicated memory card slot, free transparent case and split window for multitasking. these are some feature i like the product in my budget. this is a awesome phone.really love it. battery get draining very fast.... please do the needfull phone is nice working .best phone by amazon in this range .in the box 2 piece turbo charger and 1 usb cable but i receive only 1 turbo charger in the box..i got phone 1 usb cable and 1 turbo charger..but not receive 2 turbo charger.. i got a repacked product. i took it to service centre to check the warranty. the warranty is valid till dec2018 where as i bought the product only on 27april2018. also, its heating and battery doesn\\'t last a day. the dolby atmos and music key, notification led is good which i will miss but the seller should be good. i spoke to amazon and returned the product for refund.consider nokia 6 which has dolby atmos. its good but not that much good.after 7 months its getting problem in phone. stopped getting charged. i like but heating problem hard ware button, stopped suddenly, using soft button as of now 1.) touch is tacky and have very slow response2.) no head set/earphone supplied with this phone. one may ten to overlook this point in excitement of other specification being offered. there are better alternatives available in same price. a phone works in synergy with box packed items and if i have to buy a headphone separately, its a big no for this product. good pathetic product from amazon.too much heating with phone and low grade performance.don\\'t buy it. not working properly navigation button problemkeyboard opening problem low price best mobile i like it worst product i have received ever from amazon. it is a completely defective. accessing data/internet is a nightmare. don\\'t buy this product. it is pathetic that amazon did not allow me to return this product giving some absurd excuses. never buy this product very bad experience its an amazing experience with lenevo k8 note...no camera problemno heating problemno charging problemgood sound.. good call quality.. good picture quality after oreo update this mobile perfomance is really bad means no one can even imagine how bad it is workinv and lenovo is still not taking action. i am repenting after update the battery issue is the biggest corn and its lags most of the time i am not happy with this product. nice phonegreat speed fantastic mobile.pros* fantastic display* front and rear (13 mp) camera excellent*stock android provide no extra bugging* processor speed good* scratch proof screen.cons* lenovo update does not works properly. recently updated with android 8.0 now onwards mobile heated up and battery drains in just 2 hours of use without using call and 4g data. really sucks* mobile slightly heated up while gaming and long usage of data* rear camera (5mp) is the worst.* battery back about 8 hours* no 4k display so sometimes video quality poor. very nice phone. picture quality is awesome. sound is very clear and best for music. once charged battery remains charged for 2 days. ilove this phone. in description it mention for two turbo charger but i got only one charger. no call recorder in this phone nor any other app of call recorder is performing in this phone.lenovo k3 note was having inbuild call recorder please upgrade software with call recorder.else this phone is good. probably the best at it\\'s price.... camera is not working properly phone is losing battery very fast and heating when playing games total waste of money. wrost product. wrost camera quality. fake 4000 mah battery. device is too heat during charging & net using. total battery drain within 4 to 5 hours. worst phone getting heat like anything and battery performance is worst. not worth. many better options available in same price band. model not supported by airtel for 4g apn. i am not able to download invoice copy phone is very good but camera is average not as i expected very fast heating phone. just installed app using wifi for 2 hrs get heat. we can prepare omlet in that heat. heat o heat. otherwise well and good compare to other phones. please ask to give another software update for this heating issue. fear if it ll burst in this heat. nice with 4000 mh but camera quality of dslr mode is not so good but all configuration is well .... good quite disappointed with the product. hence returned as there were many flaws in the handset. hope lenovo rectifies them. amazing camera excellent pixel this phone is not good condition..its take a very long time to full it\\'s battery like 6 to 7 hours, turbo charger is not working..battery backup is not good...it\\'s heating a lot... over heat... good battery life, nic look very nice phone worst waste of money totaly worst product got a defective piece, even the replacement piece was defective. good product, camera quality and sound quality is quite good. overall the product is value for money in this range. i have purchased 2 nos. battery back-up is very very poor.. very nice no satisfactory though overall phone is good but there some serious issue with my phone it takes 10 hrs to charge. good nice phone in this range. camera quality is very good, battery backup is excellent. the mobile was awesome and the pics which are captured are superb..... but one drawback is it gets slightly heated while charging bad camera quality back is 13+5mp bt not clear and in my phone 1-2 very nero dot in screen ,i think it\\'s manufacturing mistake suoerrr bill very nice i upgraded from k3 note to k8 note but nothing seems best apart from memory as compared to k3 note. camera very poor quality. not advised to waste money in the phone. great phone it\\'s lagging and doesn\\'t work like a decacore processor snapdragon might be good good very nice. i am complete satisfied. good mobile very good product .performance is best for gamingbarry backup also superboverall performance is goodthanks amazon and lenovo here are the cons of this phone1. too heavy (180gms)2.heats up while playing games3. lags while gaming4. rear camera isn\\'t that good (whitish images)5. volume buttons are made up of plastic6.big bezels covers lot of space7. battery drains faster phone is very heating... otherwise ok... delivery very fast.... nice not satisfied, as the phone is getting heated very quickly not to mention just for few minutes of browsing.also the battery is not like a 4000mah which was also such a disappointment.other than that the phone packs quite a good specs.storage and speed is very good. very poor ram.dual camera feature is like fake feature.i like speed and other features (except ram and secondary 5 mp camera) one speaker not working good product osm looking best deals amazing phone and true killer of redmi note4 nice sound effectsnice camera at this costnew lookbut the only problem i facing is battery ......overall good phone at this cost....my rating --- 4.2 mobile performance very good in low light the camera performance is very poor.. battery draining very fast.. it takes much time to focus.. and depth capture not working properly... one of the best phone in the market with an excellent affordable price..the features are excellent and you get everything you want under a cheap price. lenovo mobile ones network problem comes total motherboard change. the battery drain is absolutely horrible. even while not using the phone the battery drains like crazy.i tried to return the phone only to have the amazon customer service run some kind of diagnostic on it and declare that the battery is fine essentially turning me into a liar. not at all good. antenna is very poor. not receiving the signal properly. missed many calls. besides, cameras are not of good quality. so returned the item. very good and powerful phone. everything is fine except.....1- notification light didn\\'t blink when msg and miss call arrived only blink when text msg arrived2- heating issue,3- turbo charger is not like turbo its look like normal 2 amp. charger..4- battery draning fastly5- camera lence coverd with dust after few days use... got 3 updates from lenovo within 1month. so all problems will solve. i will give full detail after few days later. till now mobile is ok. camera superb. it\\'s a great phone so far !! jack of all trades !! i would like to replace this as it is not meeting my expectations wifi connection problems and battery backup problem loved it not satisfied hoid for the amount. has latest features but not working properly. battery is getting heat while using download/ apps. as well charging. chrger is not turbo charger. it takes around 5 hrs to full charge. display & speaker are good. amazing phone good product not good battery drains very fast best mobile , camera good it is a worst phone.explanation:-1) there is signal issue with this phone. ever time it is searching and showing low signal.2) due to signal searching battery consumption very high.no other problem.i suggest do go for k8 note. not good this is my 3rd lenovo phone, not worth the money though:1. poor camera quality - though its a dual camera..2. little lagging in the games even though its deca core with 4gb ramthe only plus is that it is not a hybrid sim inspite of visit 7 times to service center, still the problem is not resolved. don\\'t buy this phone. waste of money. the phone couldn\\'t run properly just 1 year. service center & phone service employees will gave u lame excuses and tell u to wait#worstphone#shamelenovo configruation is gr8, but ui is very poor at least somethings could have been added to make it user friendly, ultimate power saver and many other basic options are missing. it heats up while charging and customization options are totally zero, i hope maybe if they give oreo update they add some features, hardware is ultimate but what its worth without a proper software utilizing it. please add some features, or make it open for us to use cyanogenmod and there will not be any warrenty void issue. good phone best phone i ever used excellent in 12000 it is a great phone some heat up issues and ram management is poor it\\'s gpu performance is slightly lower than adreno gpu in 64 gb storage i get almost 51 gb camera performance and ram management may be improve in software updates battery lasts about 1 day for heavy users.some bugs in ui .in 24 nov i simply using it and for 30 to 40 minutes it completely stop and after 1 hour it recovered.so these are my opinion regarding this phone.i bought it on sell for 12000 (4 gb ram 64 gb internal storage).so it is a decent phone for my point of view.thank you pls dont buy batteryis heating a lot wrost phone from lenovo. worst product ever brought.....has too many cons:1)it claims rapid charging but is the slowest i have ever experienced.2)claims dolby atmos sound but is not loud enough.....the sound of other mobiles are better than this.3)heating issues.so the features were not as expectedp.s.-my neighbour bought the same phone and is not satisfied with his purchase.so i recommend vivo,redmi for people looking out for phones in budget and definitely one plus for those looking out for performance...... really disappointed by lenovo. not attacheing headphone and their is issu about sound system ring tone not to be ring properly its good but looking too big never buy this phone.you will feel bad by seeing the phone\\'s1.camera quality2.turbo discharging battery3.earphone jack (not even fitting and one side is not working with my brand new earphone) discharged with in 6 hours with out playings games, browsing internet mob. is so good for

user uses jio 4g can\\'t get calls if phone in idle for 5 mins. internal memory to external memory file transfers and vice-versa taking too much time. fully disappointed by buying it. lenovo should take corrective action and should withdraw all sold phones. working is super excellent mobile device !! works superbly i using this phone camera is very poor , and no updation this lenovo k8 note camera features very very bad i am pricing this phone is 5000 because this phone wrost phone.fetures is wrost no upadatons overall no good....very bad but this mobile is 13999.... friends don\\'t buy

via bluetooth, etc...i want to return or i should sell this mobile. i am disappointed. just only worth for cost. very good prdt camera quality was not up to given standardsvery impressed with fast charging as well as battery backup.wothy mobile at this price not the beast ... camera\\'s depth sensing is not that good though very good selfie camera ..chipset is way powerfull... battery drains fast but after a software update it\\'s ok now worst product....screen cast won\\'t work which is a basic feature yes delicate. screen was broken and cost rs.4500 waste of money i purchased this phone , but i recommend to buy mi a1 or honor 6x in this price segment .. lenovo is lazy in terms of providing updates .phone have serious bugs in camera depth mode ,slow motion video is pathetic .. you will never gona use it ,front camera gives soft pictures,background app crashes ,flicking screen is there (not much),these bugs could be cured by throwing an update ,. but lenovo will not do it , because if they made this phone perfect who will gona buy there \"moto\" phones !!phone is good in terms of design and screen , it feels good in hand, stock android is a bonus. worth to use online usage as soon as i bought the mobile from the courier person, i eagerly transferred songs from my older mobile and started the google music player in lenovo k8 note to experience it\\'s fantastic dolby atmos surround sound which i had experienced in lenovo k4 note. but i was very much disappointed that lenovo k8 note doesn\\'t provide dolby atmos surround sound at all.dear manufacturers, kindly take your previous edition lenovo k4 note and check it\\'s sound and compare it with k8. it is worst as your competitor\\'s dolby atmos. don\\'t replicate those duplicate dolby atmos. come back again with dual front facing speakers as lenovo k4 which has excellent dolby atmos experience. and even, using top branded headphone, did not give much difference between \\'with dolby atmos\\' and \\'without dolby atmos\\' option.the main reason why i bought :lenovo k8 note is the lenovo\\'s real dolby atmos sound (as i thought before buying), otherwise your competiror has all other specifications as k8. but even lenovo started making false promise (like your competitor) that the mobile has \\'dolby atmos\\' by just enabling some equilizer options like just we had in 2000\\'s mobiles, but the output is \\'null\\'. good mobile for the price till date excellent product waste mobile no signal in mobile worst product supplied by amazon trader. received my new phone today dated 05/09/2017, after installing google services and my account it immediately showing blur screen and not a single button works. i have made 2-3 videos in my mobile which i definitely going to post on social media sites to aware people for not to buy lenove k8 note. worst phone..batry bckup is worst....suddenly while playing games it stops working from the first day i have gone to its service center they told that we have to update its software..they called me at 2 pm but i have gone to 4 pm to them but then were tlng it will take 1 more hour and after 1 hour they told that you will get your handset tommorow....after soft update also this problem continued..and now i m returning it..call quality is worst...my opposite side person unables to hear my voice clearly....and headphone jack also not working...when it just gets touched by my finger sound stops ar video get paused. battery back problem nothing extraordinary to call it a killer note. camera which lenovo has boasted of, is poor like all previous lenovo phones, the dual camera setup is just a gimmick and takes ordinary quality photos. dolby atmos sound output is of average quality, it was better on earlier lenovo\\'s. the headset volume while on call is very low compared to previous lenovo\\'s, redmi & mi, samsung\\'s. making k8 note pure android experience, lenovo has robbed users of some good features available on the previous lenovo\\'s. hence the software is a big let down, lenovo should have stripped down the vibe ui to near stock experience instead of dumping it. also, a phone cant be called a killer if it doesnt have the basic function of backlit keys at the bottom. software experience is not smooth as it should be considering the ram and motherboard and coupled with stock android.in my opinion, k8 note is nothing of what it was projected to be and the previous lenovo\\'s were slightly better minus the full hd displays on them. i have faced phone ringing issue!! i need to repair it!!! good received handset on 22nd & still havn\\'t start using it due to some personal problemslet me start using it then only i will b able to provide my reviewthnks super worst phone. battery heating issues. slowed down drastically. better not to go with this company for purchase of the mobile. waste of money not a good mobile very nice phone.camera is very good.no heating issue.very satisfied. hi all, i have bought new lenovo k8 note. frankly speaking lenovo making fool to customer through this product. just for marketing they have given higher features in this price(like 4gb ram, 64gb rom, dual camera) but all are of no use. if you buy some other company with lesser feature compared to this you will get much better experience. the most stupid thing lenovo done is very basic features they have removed like led notification is there but it never works except during charging, no call recording, no shortcuts for screen shot. i got alert saying low. battery and 15% was there then automatically switched off immediately.these feedback by just exploring little, let me explore more than i ll share with more feedback features at this price are not regrettable but the price slashed by 1000 in just one month made me think about the brand as a wholeso. all said, it is a decent deal at this price if you are not concerned about the camera quality. good phone in this price. product is good nice packing without earphones battary drained fastits look like ordinary charger it i s taking 2 and half hour full chargeweight is more compare todays phone very worst product don\\'t buy k 8 while charging it getting highly heat pls pls don\\'t buy good product superb configuration in 14k sir kindly provide my lenovo k8 note handfree .there is no handfree in box excellent, fabulous smart phone.no lag, no heating, no battery problems. it was osm ... awesome worst experience after 20-22 days of use ....battrey backup was low like 3000mah and charging speed getting slow ... i want my money back 😑 very bad i just wasted my money i\\'m so sad because i\\'m not satisfy about this phone. 1st from day first network problem not sporting 4g sim 4g network. i\\'m using airtel sim i never got full network in this phone. i changed slot 1 slot 2 but always week network. same sim when i\\'m using in my other phone oppo a57 it\\'s working good. getting heat while charging. you can see in pictures below attached. in second slot also i\\'m using airtel but when i start switch on internet my network lost automatically. i seen youtube lenovo customer reviews vedio with same problem. now i\\'m so sad because i waisted my money with this phone. redmi is much better then lenovo in this price. in future i never will try to buy lenovo /moto .im very disappointed . so far no issues with performance .best phone in this budget. super camera and best performance the phone has some problem with outgoing calls as the recipient is not able to hear clearly. memory and speed is good. big phone to keep in pocket. mera bill kho gya hai please mere email par bill bhej dijiye good mobile but some options are missing like infrad ray i love this mobile battery backup is not better worst product. don\\'t go for it. most of the functions are not working. even the earphone 3.5 jack port is not functioning. i\\'m using this set for last 1 month, till date is working properly, but regarding the speed it\\'s not the app too fast as compare to first week of the purchase.only the bad thing in this set, is camera auto focusing & stablity is not good. this product is awesome very bad phone. it\\'s take long time to charge and no battery backup as it have 4000 mah. very bad. no usable of power charger . take 7 to 8 hour for full charge the battery. when i charge phone is hitting . good pls don\\'t buy great no problem satisfied wow so amazing phone the lenovo k8 note is really a killer phone if you are searching for a smart phone that is totally balanced from all prospects then this is your phone.😍but why lenovo why you used mediatek😭 very bad experience with the product and also with the amazon policy. the mobile is getting very hot while charging, talking on phone, listening of music. don\\'t trust on lenovo k8 note while purchasing online. don\\'t buy this phone at all its batteries draining very fast and camera\\'s qualities very poor on return request phone has been tested through their software showing everything ok just check the credentials that software poor rank given by all.see the photos and qualities of 13 mega pixels are no worth of 5 mega pixels.lenovo killer note 8 poor than lenovo vibe 5. super mobile don\\'t take this phone,camera is not good as of 13 mp, specially front one is worst.heating problem is occurred during little bit heavy use like on playing game and video\\'s.it is heated up drastically on calling.i want to return it but amazon refused to take it back.over all, not good it is. as per commitment not received idea data 122 gb so so good phone in this price in this price segment, the most desirable phone for photoholics... awesome camera configurations...but heating problem is an issue that is to be considered. otherwise, marvellous one. screen was broken.asked to replace the set but didn\\'t get any positive resonde received with no issues and on time. phone/charger not working properly please exchange my phone lots of issues with lenovo k8 vibe. as there is network issue with this mobile. if you put same sim card in other mobile it works fine but call doesn\\'t get connected in lenovo mobile it gets over heated during short usage plz don\\'t go for it go for samsung or other product and it\\'s performance is very good no lag in between usage works perfectly thanks great product. do not buy this phone many features missing not at al worth to buy for that price exlent its very bad as said by some reviewers. sound exp was very poor camera qualiy is awful. hoping to get my return.... battery backup low,nd heating to much during net and charge it\\'s awesome it hangs and camera effect less awesome phone.....very good experience phone start up 10 mins only use.but phone over heat phone is to good but heting good mobile. i need invoice for that phone. kindly send my registered mail id.need urgent lenovo k8 note (venom black, 4gb) with new system update where is the system update, we have to check the update, only os 7.1.1 is updated(naught) not oreo 8.1 . then why you are mentioning it as with system update.the purchase date of the mobile was 20/09/2017 and the warranty expires in 8 days (on 08/june/2018) when checked online on the lenovo product check (official lenovo warrenty check) over all performance is good but phone is getting heated up when plugged into charging.. will suggest to go for redmi note 4 instead of lenovo k8... - primary camera not worthy- cast screen not able to detect any smart tv\\'s- screen sharing option not available- no parallel apps options- unable wifi connections though strong wifi- mobile data connection breaks for every minute- screenshot option is pathetic- many smart options which are available in budget phones are not available in this phone.- heating and hanging is another problem- could not able to find call recording options.looks to me most of problems can be resolved with appropriate updates and software enhancements so i will amend rating once lenovo address above issues, if lenovo not keen to address basic issues then you will get better options even in budget phones also. i thought i\\'ll b getting earphones with the box but it\\'s just a phone superbbb!! excellent in all respect. finger print scanner has stopped working ok from the very next day the finger print lock sensor of the handset stopped working. network and battery heating prob data cable of this product is not working the product is not worth the money at all. the battery backup is very bad and phone keeps on restarting frequently. would like to get another product or refund. this lenovo divice is overheated while charging and while mobile data turned on. lenovo not give the task manager and camera is best but one speaker is not work. and cellular network is very good. i use this phone i feel good its deliver 1day prior to scheduled time which was nice. specification says its a volte supported phone but in reality its not. need to install a jio4gvoice if want to use jio sim in it for making and receiving calls. cant make or receive calls on jio network if connected to wifi which is pathetic. overall i am not happy due to all of these issues. great phone, with the stock android it\\'s the smoothest phone that i have used till date. the built quality is also descent and the front and rear cameras perform good. this phone is for heavy users like me . and the 4000 mah battery is good enough for a full day\\'s work. if you are looking for a phone that is all rounder in this range, the k8 note is always a great option. one thing that i left out is the sound quality which is good being backed by dolby atmos . this 4gb ram varient is very good. although the 3gb ram varient has some issues . but this one is completely fine. very bad product from lenovo battery is overheating so much i bought this phone in first sale. i inserted one of my two mobile sims & then started updating/downloading the application and then thought to insert the second sim. when i tried to do so, the sim slot was not opening at all. i have raised the return request but unable to do so as no one is able to remove the sim card, even mobile repairing shops.charging is not fast.dual camera is better than regular 13 mp.mobile is just ok.amazon team helped in refund process. happy with amazon but i may not buy this phone again. lot\\'s of issues, bo not buy this phone super not so good.expected better product.the phone is little bit slow & battery is not that good.brought at high price.later price dropped. overall satisfied, value for money no doubt in that. but battery performance is not up to mark. earlier was using panasonic eluga a2 with 4000 mah battery which will last whole day and will be about 34% -25% balance charge. but this one draining battery faster. overall it\\'s good choice. turbo charger also not giving any speed to change fast. actually it\\'s taking 1 hour to 1:30 hours to charge full lt\\'s very awesome handset and features are excellent and specially it\\'s easy to operate camera not capturing pictures,and the battery is like 2000 mah the mobile sucks waste of money expected alot from the lenovo but it failed i am received the lenovo k8 note ,i am using this mobile eighteen days. the main problem is battery draining is very fast. battery is taking 4 hours to charge and getting drain in 6 hours. incoming calls not receiving at times even though full signal. it\\'s consume very much memory. heating issue comes after some hour use. dual rear camera is not working. always hanging this phone,,,it\\'s quality is too bad.not something good for buying.also amazon has a cheating policy now a days for return and refund. they are asking for some local app to check the phone. which doesn\\'t have battery checking option. the games start to lag a little bit after playing for a hour and gets heated up (not expecting from new phone , don\\'t know what happens when it gets old ) but phone have rigid body , phone ram fills up to 75% sometimes not so handy while gaming.......and finally stop decreasing it\\'s cost it hurts us a lot😂😂 phone is good...best in class..but battery is not much like 4000 with respect to price and features...this is a perfect smart phone that anyone can have it. there is a heating issue in this device and finger print sensor does not work in 1st time........ i\\'d say it\\'s a ok phone. heating up like a hell. otherwise it\\'s a ok phone. if you\\'re a gamer, i\\'d recommend not to buy this phone. jhakass fully satisfied with the product. happy :) turbo charger is not working. .well..or camera picture quality is worse ..very disappointing. .. after using 10days writingit\\'s awesome phone with powerfull battery,ram,dual camera everything k i\\'m happy with it i purchased lenovo k8 note on 26th september, it\\'s working good for two months. suddenly problem arises, didn\\'t understand what happened suddenly, phone getting discharged fastly and when i charge the phone it will take more time almost 6hrs to complete full charge and moreover phone is getting too heat while charging. it\\'s not happened for first two months., but it\\'s totally disappointed.is there any chances in getting exchange to the product waste of money if you are looking for simple and sweet phone then go with this handset.. if you are a basic user like using normal whatsapp instagram nad few other apps in daily usage then it is good.... battery life is average. camera is also average..... you can say it is giving the performance for the price which you are paying. nice phn writing this review after eight months of using this phone, this phone is very good in it\\'s build qualitysupereb! front 13 megapixel camera with quit powerful front flash. performance is very good i play a lot of games does not lag in gameing.cons- when talking about the cons of this product is that, the bokeh mode and the blur effect is not very good just average same goes to battey backup just a bit less not as good as mi phones on heavy usage you have to charge it again in the evening. bluetooth is not working properly with my speaker getting breaking sound most of the time nice mobile but some network issues detected volume keys not working volume auto matically going to zeo and going to silent mode, dual camera didn\\'t work100℅charging takes 4.5hoursturbo charge doesn\\'t workwent to lenovo service centre ,they didn\\'t solve my query .i want solution for this problem . very good phone ♥️ super battery backup is not good. full charge lasts upto 8 hours medium utilization. camera quality is also not good. sometimes hangs and heating issue.don\\'t buy at this price. go for mi a1. similar configuration at 14999. phone are regularly heat and his temperature is continue to over heat.video song is not clearly play.battery back up is very poor because phone are continue to heat in time of open mobile data and charging good dislikeenhanced 4g volte,lte mode are not showing, the best product released by lenovowhich gives a excellent performance in gaming and multi tasking and the best feature in this phone is the split screen excellent phone better than redmi note 4. it does heat up occasionally not every time and that too not that much. battery performance is i would say above average as it lasts almost 1 day with 4000 mah battery. performance is great. no complaints with the phone. loved it. best phone in this price range( 10k) .. updated software removed all previous issue good product. camera is awesome with in builth editing give somewhat professional looking photos.battery is average drain at faster speed same as turbo charging (had high exception from battery using p1 )iphone style sim ejector is annoyingoverall performance is smooth like makan:@s smooth as f*#kcharger provided is not turbo it\\'s regular not a good product heating problem n some softwear problem battery still hitting when charging and fingerprint sensor hanging problem....!!!! *best phone * camera quality is very good the charger of this product is not working... called amazon customer care but they are refusing to change it... what the hell is this ?? nice fone i have not received the ear phones from the sealed box of lenovo i am using it from past 8 months, worst phonecast like basic function is not working. worst ever phone of my life,,,, dont purchase its horrible this can be a good product if lenovo improves its depth camera, battery life and not so good network connectivity.otherwise cool product.turbo charging takes 2+ hrs to fully charge.depth camera looks like some sort of software tweak. very poor battery. phone heats slot and take 2.5 hours to charge there is no turbo charging. ummaah to bolby atmos. i love this device also due to stock android os. bass is very detailed. use 16 ohms earphones (sennheiser cx 300 ii or cx 180 only as they\\'ll give enough loudness. i love its sound output. audio output is 3 times better than my iphone. motorola and lenovo are my permanent brands from now. i regret for returning my moto g6. people are fools who buy any other brand when it comes to android os. google should consider motorola phones as their flagship device. after 5 days of usage i find some issues in my lenovo k8 note. whenever i install a new app i can\\'t find the app in my app list. when this happens i should restart my phone then only i can see the app in my app list.not only that whenever i use my share it and minimises it then i found some glitches on my lock screen and home screen also and this happen with asphalt 8 too.please tell me someone that why this happens to my lenovo k8 note and what should i do this.is there anyone to know about this please tell me... wast of giving 1 for mobile and also for amazon also not at all good battery performance hear the problem was battery and they are telling in ok good in the smart check there is no option about battery plz plz plz don\\'t buy the mobile wast of money 14000 rs battery back up is not good, you have to charge minimum twice/thrice a day, yesterday i changed the battery from authorized service center, but the problem is still same.worst phone i have ever seen. very good product signal reception is bad. mobile data does not work well. as it\\'s dual standby, only one sim can be used for data at once. if you have jio, either you can use it for data and other sim for calls or you have to switch to the other sim.turbo charging is fine. v v good worst product. don\\'t bye it not worth for 1 rupees. don\\'t waste money awesome phone ,really fast loaded many apps still works smoothly,battery life is great but decreases rapidly if under 20%.not updated out of the box, has to be updated 5 to 6 times. dislike awesome phone ..........very smooth functioning handset. really waste the screen is not including the gorilla glass it\\'s lenovo waste item don\\'t waste money it\\'s better to prefer other phones in same budget.. nice phone. i have ordered k8 note it has come with transparent back cover.how come? it has fitted with mobile too. is this complementary? nice mobile nice product but late delivery by courier boy. it doesn\\'t get charge while it is on or some time get charge but very slowly around 6% per hour.soyou have to charge it 16 hours to get full charged.it get charge while it is switched off.it seems there is sone software problem in the mobile but lenovo is not resolving it.very much disappointed.this problem began when i updated the software.i am a regular user of lenovo but this time i am very much disappointed. absolutely nonsense. it is supposed to be splash proof but within 7 days rendered useless after i wet in rain. good phone, very good delivery from amazon very bad mobile from lenovo pls don\\'t buy battery backup is worst turbocharger won\\'t work at all hangs sometimes camera is very slow overall bad phone the battery backup sucksand the camera stops many times after continuous usage and if you want to use your camera again than you need to restart the phonethe flashlight is not good because it gives a yellow type color on picturesi have returned this itemnow i\\'m gonna buy tenor glet\\'s give a try to that new companyanyways i was a very old user of lenovoi don\\'t why but their battery backup sucksthe display is not good when comes to watching videoand bluetooth is not at all good after updating the second / third updatetheir is a huge of cons which cannot be tolerated! great mobile thanks for your phone evrything okk but camera quality and music quality not good like we expected not like at all.battery backup is poor and dual camera setup is worst.navigation keys on bottom without back light is made it worst. worst battery...i want to return the phone... it\\'s budget mobile k but average oly awesome phone by looks....and all d features are working good. camera is fabulous.happy to choose this phone.... nice camera quality not good.. headphone is missing pleas cheak issues:-1.screen cast or mirroring is not at all working..2. battery is getting heated up very fast.3. camera is not up to mark.4. phone is getting heated up even for less load.finally i returned this phone. best mobile... this mobile is too bad once you update i update my mobile then i face too much heating issue and mobile apps are not working and also there is battery drainage issue after oreo updation pathetic product by lenovo ear phones not given absolutely useless phone in this range. pls don\\'t go for it. battery worst. nothing great in this phone except good battery life. phone heats a lot. function buttons at the bottom do not have backlight, this is a big issue if you know. sound is ok. size is too big. it\\'s really really good phone with small price. sound quality is very good. i had tried many brands in past but none has worked out well for me. thanks to amazon. product not soo good its ok. and in this product gives dual camera but use only one camera, main mobile over heat issue heating issue.......... it\\'s heats up in short time , for charging it\\'s takes around 3 to 4 hour and worst part takes same time to drain without using it for whatsup , you tube,or gaming feels hot in hand. holding phone more than 10 to 15 min feels scary too as if it will gets burst . long charging time huge issue. i bought this phone on flash sell for rs13999. now it is in the price range below rs.12000. the reason is obvious. very poor battery back up. camera is below average. finger sensor is staggering to recognise. sometimes hanged to execute simple applications which ran smoothly in my earlier smart phone whose configurations are far below than this. i assure what they promised actually is a total failure. don\\'t waste your valuable money into it. i doubt whether the company can rectify or upgrade the performance by software upgradation. the only positive think (?) is it\\'s look and screen size. feeling sorry how amazon can promote this product with such vigorous advertisement. mobile is too bad and lot of network issue good product with good packaging. fake dual camera... depth mode is of no use. its just edits the pic and the produced pic feeld like badly edited... battery sucks... heating problem... no volte... jio sim won\\'t work unless you use jio app. dual camera is fake... even when you place you finger in front of the 5mp camera, your phone will still take a blurred background pic which clearly says that the pics are edited and the 2nd 5mp camera is of no use. on offer this product is great.but redmi note 5 is a good competitor of k8 note. battery is okay. picture & and sound qualities are awesome.worth every penny. excelant awesome phone at this price range.stock android is a bit annoying after using so many oem veraions. but as time elapses, you get used to it... nice productsome 🔋 issue though battery life rating is high, the cheap and slow mediatek processor lowers the battery capacity. best in his category. battery is very bad.turbo charger is very very slow.battery draining in just 4 hours.plz don\\'t go for it.camera are poor plz do not purchase, as lenovo\\'s stock android is having lot of issues and still lenovo has not taken any action to correct them. hardware wise it is nice but lacks updates phone getting overheating since the day 1 the mobile absolutely good for some of its unique features at this price.it had a dedicated sd card slot,front flash,extra music button and so on.... iam using this for a month and i\\'m fully satisfied. one point i like to add here is,other than fingerprint the face recognition works soo good and unlocks in less than 0.5 seconds . this phone had a very great user experience. thanks to lenovo.but one disadvantage is that it doesn\\'t support screen cast to smart televisions and other devices. awesome and nice phone really a #killer note, really a#killer camera, really a #killer performances hence a #killer note mobile is awesome no any ssue found in mobile quick, timely delivery by amazon. but battery back of phone not good, take lot of time to charge completely. also on off takes too much time. nice phone and hardware worst phone ever. within month overheating, slow charging, and software damn slow. i think there should be a check on what they write online to allure customers. never buy this nice phone ,rear camera is average but taking good shots, performance awesome, no heating issue getting warm on normal use all over it\\'s balanced smartphone. nice and super very bed phone value for money. this was good deal. i have baught this when this was released. even after the several month of use there is no issue . awesome phone, in every manner, super fast processing, brilliant camera..go for it.. 👍 worst phone ever ever ever !!!!!!trust me dont buy this product ....... good phone i ordered this phone and it showed that they would deliver me the latest version of android 8.0 oreo. they delivered me a old version and as well as the device was faulty. i showed this phone to the lenovo service center, they said that this device is faulty and suggested that we should return this back to amazon. i then contacted the amazon customer care service but they refused to take the device back as the device return period was over which is completely accepted by me but these guys cheated on me as they delivered me a faulty piece and refused to take the phone back. the phone does not catch the signal of the wifi even if the router is next to it. i also have two tablets of lenovo, they connect to wifi instantly from anywhere in the house, this was happening because of the old 7.1.1 noughat version so i went to the lenovo service center and upgraded it to a android 8.0 oreo but then the condition became even worse and it also stopped getting signal. i am not satisfied with my device and i want this faulty device to be taken back by amazon and return me my rs.11650. the amazon has cheated on me as the return back policy does not allow me to make a replacement of this device. i want amazon to tale back my device as soon as possible. lot of mobiles and other items purchase this is first time i will write bad review for product improve i am not tell totaly waste this mobile some disappoint points i observe last three days.frequently restart mobile during large file or multi file selection copy or deleting.over heat issues observe on trasparent cover because mobile produce tomuch heat.cast screen not working battery backup not so good quality issue wonderful phone at this cost.not much satisfied with camera quality...otherwise too fix. excellent product and excellent service by amazon music button is not working i have bought this phone from offline store, next month in may it would be 1 year that i am using this phone. the phone is good, camera good in lighted areas, speed is good, battery is good but what has annoyed me the most is the temperature. you charge the phone, surf, use social media, play games, do whatever, it heats up so much that you won\\'t be able to hold it. i play games, i use two usb fans, connected to my laptop, pointed at the back of the phone, and a damp cloth to keep playing. it heats up with in 5 minutes of playing any game. when i charge, i keep the fan running. for just this one issue all the plus points of this phone goes down the drain. in would not buy another lenovo and would not recommend buying k8 note. extremely disappointedcharging time mire than 3 hours and battery drain with in 3 hours, without heavy use.. good one but galary app is not inbuilt n earplug must be given with mobile phone. greetings, on 18th january 2018, there was a software update prompt which came on my mobile, i had downloaded and kept the installation for next day. on 19th january 2018 late evening while the software update was getting installed, the mobile conked off and ever since i have been unable to reboot the mobile.looks like this has been the same issue faced by other users for this model.let us know if you need the imei number for the handset.currently i am travelling and in dhaka, will be returning to chennai during the first week of february 2018.i would like a refund or an alternate mobile for the same price.thankssriram battary problem.over heating & earlier down problem.wht can i do?? very worst experience...got empty box bedluk my life this product nice phone. quick and fast n light to operate, doesn\\'t drag it\\'s way from one app to another. quite satisfied, very well fit n finish too. battery decent life.cons. it\\'s a tad big for my taste, but decent. it does not get a proper screen guard, as it\\'s little curved from sides, screen guards don\\'t stick from corners or sides. ram although 4 gb on paper, actually it\\'s only 3.7, n out of it too 3 pre occupied mostly.decent enough 100% worth your money, only competition i can think of is redmi note 5 call recoder application is not working properly excellent phone love it... dont buy this product. very worst camera this mobile phone is good in this range from other mobile phones. camera is really awesome and performance is much better than other phone. poor mobile is hiting to calling and charging phone is very goodbut 1week after the phone charged slowly and fastly discharged how can i return the product?not happy with product im using this phone from last 3 days based on my experience i can say that this phone is not worth of 14k phone is too bulky no premium look. both front and back camera is ok but 2 much of waist of space in home keys. i have observed heating also while playing youtube videos. in this price range there r good phones available in market like lg q6 and nokia 6 feeling my hard earned money waisted. i got exicited by looking into configuration but after receiving phone im too disappointed ,dont feel like using hand .can give 2 star only for new processor n battrey. way too big and too heavy - more useful as a weapon or a hammer good quality and good looking no voice recorder i expected backlight on touch buttons which is absent rest is gud why the hell there is no gallery before i was using k4 note it was much handy and has super function in it. very bad hand, internet not working in this set. pathetic service. camera is too damn poor.no volte. no earphones.didn\\'t worth the money paid for. good. worth the money my data cable is not working..i bought this phone in the month of september, from where i can get replacement..? good phone. worthfull there is mentioned as turbo charger but there is not turbo charger in it. so nice handset for lenovo k8 note vary bad mobile is heating and quickly dischargingno tv screen share was allowing excellent one of the best... mobile getting heated.. battery not stable..phone hanging much... one of the best smart phone in cheap price.... not gorla glass lenovo k8 note mobile is very poor mobile.that mobile very problem1-bettry backup very poor .2-back camera(5mp)not working .3- it is not volte only lte .4- that mobile verry hot .5- funtation velly slow .6- operating verry bad . i bought this phone, even though i am already having lenov vibe k5 note assuming this phone is the game changer. but to my disappointment not much changes compared to lenovo vibe k5 note. even though there a slight increase of 500 mah bettery life, but you wont experience that increase. while taking photo, shot on the screen appear smaller than vibe k5 note. but low light photos are slighly better in lenovo k8 note. even some of the features are missing in lenovo k8 note like super battery save mode etc. not that great buy. so far so good.. best in the price range. looking nice,,cemara superb.perparmence good.but cell heating. nice camera is poor. lenovo k8 note is very good product at this time of android generation. it has great speed & look. best ever phone good camera quality good ram best feachers lenovo is best looking good , phone not hanging, battery very good phone is good; but is too large.. difficult to hold in hand. also the ui is not very user friendly. i am

banking apps ,my printer app not respond some times then i have to force stop it then it works.5. sound of speaker are not up to mark campared with my previous k4 note. good no call recorder heats a lot in web browsing like you tube gaming and downloading no speed dialing no response from amazon customer care he says when ur phone heats 48 degree then we will return or replace 40 degree is not a heating issue nice phone for every one in 10999. very good mobile lenovo k8 note lenovo k8 camera. is very bad not working rare dull camerabattery is not bower full100% change continue use 6

hot when it is in use an ok phone . for a 14k price many superior options are available very good phone.works faster in the budgeted space.have heating issue. battery drains so fast..didn\\'t meet the expections of 4000mah an okay phone. nothing to make a wow feel. battery drains very fast. i don\\'t know how does a 4000 mah lip battery drains like this. can\\'t stay with phone in on mode in night even if u charged 100℅ in the morning. camera is average. processes very fast and no hang or delay in accessing apps and all. i won\\'t recommend this phone. this is a genuine review after a 2 weeks very hard core use. excellent product which i was looking for.a lenovo fan since last 1 decade. good value for the money. but, has some irritating issues like getting powered off, while charging. nice phone in budget of 12000.good network quality while calling in jio network.no need to mobile data on to calling by jio. no good i bought a k8 plus and it uses a 5.2v charger, normal 5v charger does not work with the phone. normal charger takes more than 16hrs to charge the phone, if it charges at all.please check if this is a problem with k8 note the worst cell i\\'ve ever used waste of moneyafter using 20days my mobile display full of dead pixelsi dont kow wt to do super nice item very bad and very poor software and more battery consumption tottaly very baf nic mobile vth gud cam and screen lenovo k8 note phone is very bad networking problem network slots is very low quality heating issue and speed not like 4gb ram lenovo k8 note found to be excellent product under this price range. thank you amazon team for offering this service. i am traveling a problem for this product this product are software problem and i don\\'t set up singtone and i don\\'t back up my secure thing and app... good quality but slow nice budget phone i am happy with this phone it\\'s really a better option comapre to others in this budget. great phone at affordable price. five star and thumbs up. very good enjoy best superfast experience with 2.3ghz deca core processor. i would recommend everyone to not buy mediatek chip enabled phones lenovo is still a very good company you can look for lenovo p2 the fastest charging on the world with the highest battery backup and with samsung\\'s super amoled display and sony camera go for it without any doubts.and with the best chip i.e. sd 625 at only 13499 on flipkart satisfaction guarantee nice phone good if u r music lover don\\'t buy this phone phone is good but battery backup is not good really awesome product battery pick up good the phone is hanging maximum times and battery is draining rapidly than my earlier lenovo k8 note.what is the reason i don\\'t know. i am writing this review after 3 months of usage. i received quite a number of software updates. i am happy on that front. the software experience is just fantastic. it is currently running oreo. the portrait mode is just ok. nothing exceptional. the camera modes are good too. i feel the ram management could have been better. coming to the main part. the battery life is utter nuisance. it doesn\\'t hold up like a 4000mah battery. if u r willing to purchase it for its battery, please stay away. i charged the battery to 80 percent in the morning at around 8.30 n found the battery to be 52 percent at around 4 p.m. the thing to be noticed is that the device was used not a bit. it was idling the whole while. the performance of the phone is very good. it does get warm while charging and playing games but nothing unbearable. except camera, i think rest of the other stuff is same like other lenovo phones, i don\\'t feel this phone have any extra ordinary quality. look and feel is total low quality phonemoney waste dual camera is not workingworst phone by lenovo...all the application suddenly stops working while using it...if it\\'s the last phone on earth still don\\'t buy. lenovo claims deca core processor but performancene is lesser than the phone having four core processor. phone ok but some lag in gaming and camera not perform well may be software issue... overall gud package little costly good good phone and excellent features for this price it\\'s worst phone.amazon is the one reason to by this phone . amazon ad shows(good killer performance,good camera quality, battery back,etc...).. it\\'s not worth for this.already i have htc desire 816g . lenonvo is not worth for that..lenonvo is worst company they give a fake ads bad phone its got heating problem.. and finger print unlock is like only for phone and the 5 mp back camera is a drawback. its not a water repellent phone. lenovo doesnt have any water proof phone.. so dont buy this phone .. i really had a bad experience with phone and service center people..and if you go to lenovo service center for warranty these people will talk about their policies first instead of providing a solution . they cant solve any of your phone issue and they move on. not satisfied worst phone ever seen for that price range. waste of money very good dont ever buy this mobile because it does not have screen mirror feature .even cheap mobiles have this feature. this review is a exact outcome of using this mobile for more than a month.pros and cons:--------------------------1. battery backup close to 2 days approximately including idle time, internet and call usage. so rest assured, you are in good hands. i have attached screenshot of my battery usage.note: keep your mobile charge for at least 8 hours before the first time use.2. turbo charge great as expected. so yes, it gives your cell more time in hand.3. camera hdr feature really capture detailed images. front camera with flash is a nice feature.4. this phone works with 4g, 3g and 2g speeds.5. dual separate nano sim slot and additionally it has separate memory card slot for external storage. you will never run out of storage issues.6. fingerprint sensor response time is very faster and you can use the same for taking photos. additionally you can use it as a app lock for unlocking important apps.but you have to install separate app from play store (cons).7. google personal assistant feature is awesome.8. dedicated music key in left. but you can also use this as a shortcut for few useful actions like taking screenshot and camera.9. call management is really difficult, need to download apps from play store for setting call waiting and etc.. (cons)10. voice recorder need to be downloaded separately (cons)11. hardware is really awesome but software needs lots of customization. (cons)12. just double tap to awake the phone and you can see the time and date without unlocking it.13. press the volume key and click on the bell symbol to put your phone on vibrate and silent.there should be some shortcut has to be provided for this (cons)14. design of this phone is an absolute killer.15. cast screen option is only supported with chrome cast device. so you cannot share anything with smart tv without this casting device. (cons)however you can play youtube videos from phone to smart tv with inbuilt youtube application which comes with casting.overall it\\'s a good phone and worthy for money you pay, because it has lot customizations needed to be done and have to download apps for basic things. so my rating is 4 stars.. perfect mobile in this budget mobile overheating not not backup in battery overall nice performance.. very comely phone...great!!! how to custom ringtone set ? bahot try kiya lekin company ki default ringtone set ho rahi he lekin custom ringtone set nahi ho rahi he ???????good but not very good ,front camera good and rear camera good some time mobile volume key not working and mobile network issue, custom ringtone ka option nahi he bakwas mobile he have a wonderfull feed back from my friend bcz gifted him.. jio sim network issue. while using jio sim even if the range is showing in the status bar the calls are not getting some time. the person who calling is hearing that my number is out of coverage. jio is in the primary slot. pros:----------:- 4gb ram enough for multitasking.:- 10 core processor:- 64 gb space:- camera blurring effect.:- good battery life of 4000mahcons:------------&:- earphones not available.:- must be gorilla glass. the product i received is defective. one of the two is not working. left speaker is not working and right speaker is working. i want to replace the product but the steps for returning the product is not proper on amazon. it says to down load the smart check app. i did that and run the app. but the app says my product is good. i called amazon and explained the issue. he says to move to nearest authorised service center and get the letter that the product is defective. don\\'t know how the problem will be settled. the phone(lenovo k8 note (venom black, 4g) is short life phone my phone was hanged and completely dead .i used the phone only one and half month with the maximum care . please help me how to use warranty received my phone on scheduled date,the phone looks good camera is also nice both front and back. got oreo update after 5 days and since then the performance has increased.phone is good for regular users. goodbut earphone missing.... lenovo always has great specs on paper and poor performance & stability in real-life.this is my 3rd & last lenovo (over 6 years) - k3 note didn\\'t work well. vibe had battery reboot issues and went to repair center twice. now this.k8-note issues(1) very poor battery. particularly with gps on, it dies far more rapidly than samsung or any other phone(2) poor drivers. when i plug in the ear phone and remove them, the normal speaker stops working. can\\'t hear voice on incoming calls. needs reboot.(3) wifi is flaky. connection drops suddenly. picks up again.(4) hangs when multiple apps are opened. suddenly you find you cannot even take incoming calls.all this within 6-8 months of purchase of the phone.adieu lenovo. i tried hard to like you. the killer note\\'s killer indeed. using it since 2 weeks .. no such lags or problems faced yet.. initially there were bugs which was solved with the provided update. the dual camera setup is just a myth! overall battery performance is awesome. after 15 days the charger had stoped working and no complain had been taken regarding it for me worthless phone dear sir when i use mobile from delivery date 8 0ct2017 charging is not 100% we can turbo charger pinned properly full day charging bt not complete 100% why?pls i request help me and provide good service excellent mobile....excellent reae and front camera.....due to stock android spped of mobile is excellent....battery last for 13-14 hrs...display is good... have a rough use of 5 mnt then the phone quite warm and battery backup is not so good like 4000 mh only 3 hours on after update to android 8 version this product is v v v v bad... plz don\\'t buy lenovo phone because camera and display is v v v low quality... nice n slim the performance is awesome but camera is better in k8 plus very nice...... heating problem and sensors are not working good mobile set it\\'s a poor quality and i face many problem like network issue and heating problemdon\\'t buy only waste of money satisfied but some problems compared to old mobiles in deurability waste of money..don\\'t buy excellent product. nice boss i recently purchase this mobile..there is some heating problem..sometime some apps stop working and also its ui and i need to use pattern instead of fingerprint lock as says to activate fingerprint first pattern.. back camera is worst..but build quality and front camera is awsome in this price range.. i think it has 481 ppi ..bt small size video pays looks bad..its video play quality s worst..i problem can be fix by updates.. waiting for that if not solve than i have to return it.. 😒😒 good phone .nice camera nice look waste brand lenovo not value for money products good mobile.solid build. multitasking is so buttery. ram management can be better, lenovo need to work on this. battery backup is better after the recent september security patch.dual camera setup is just a gimmick, the dept mode is just waste of time and money. single primary camera from both front and back take decent pics. camera app definitely need improvement.the capacitive buttons are not backlit, but didn\\'t faced any issues in dark.the most annoying thing about the mobile is, suddenly a popup raises and says amazon app is not responding or some other \\'x\\' app is not responding and sometimes i am not able to launch some heavy apps after installing from google play store.mobile heatsup only while charging, didn\\'t faced issue while playing games like asphalt air borne, war robots. but there were frame drops while playing war robots. powerful phone nice reasonable price...better phone...fast delivery..thank you..amazone excellent product good phone..lot of improvements in camera..however battery back up is bad compare to earlier lenovo phone like vibe p1 turbo. k8 note lacks feature of restricting auto start of apps which was there in earlier phones. hence battery drains fast in k8 note.though turbo charging but it takes almost 2 hours to full charge.also one of the most irritating thing is notification volume is same as ring volume which disturbs your routine because if you keep ring volume high then notification sound is also highno schedule power on-off featurewe expect some add-on features by lenovo to overcome these issues every thing seems good except the battery life. there is some issues in the phone. in status bar time is not updating properly.sound quality is bad i think it\\'s software issue. it vary time to time.headphone sound is not buzzing lenovo k6 power is better in many ways than the k8 note like low budget (9999&10999), good speaker sound ( more loud & clear sound than k8 note) with dual speaker back side (k8 note has only 1 speaker at bottom), more battery backup with same 4000mah battery( k6 power\\'s battery consumption is very less than k8 note, you can use k6 powwr for more hours than the k8 note with full charged battery), comfortable size (5\" screen, easily fit in pocket), free in-box earphones (in k8 note earphones are not provided), more features than k8 note.k6 power lounched 6months before lounching of k8 note. but still it(k8 note) doesn\\'t have functionality which k6 power already has.functions which is not in k8 note are as follows:1) wide touch(to lock phone, shortcut for many recent app, its just like apple button)2) quick snap (double tap volume button to take screen shot)3) smart scene (to open any action by time or by on connecting any device like wifi etc, by this function you can set your brightness low for night time by set action time 8:00 pm - 7:00 am, or silent your phone between office hours automatically many other things)4) fingerprint snap: you can take photos by touching fingerprint sensor)5)dual app profile: (two whatsapp/fb account simultaneously)6) quick flashlight: (by tapping home button twice)7) secure zone, guest mode: (in secure zone you can install same apps with different account and that apps can only work when you open secure zone with password) the phone seems alright with just about 2 weeks of using it. i did come across an error with the phone.process stopped responding and i had to restart my new phone. hangouts is another app that just crashed when i started using it on this phone. lastly, the battery is not exactly living up to the expectations of being a 4000 mah battery. else the features, look, audio, camera are all good. it\\'s quite smooth is handling it.there is no headset that comes along with this handset. awesome good product in this prise range.i found camera quality is good as compare to other phones in the same prise range. display is also good. sometime phone gets heat after using for long time, maybe because the processor. 1st time using lenovo mobile it was quite good. but only negativity is it\\'s camera quality. verygood product very worst phone i have used having issue with this phone everyday need to restart it good phone with good storage my phone turbo charge feature is not working very good phone. i am using this from last more than 1 month.i am fully satisfied. networks connectivity issues. i\\'m not getting any incoming calls and otps. system&updates occupied 16gb memory. awsm product with lovely features best phone worth for money fast delivery thanks for amazon best mobiles flop product damaged. shape of mobile is bend.. good product....good seller camera... performance is very weak....i think lenovo just... kidding with dual camera because we can\\'t the blur the background...so it will be a huge joke for.... awesome product... battery back up is too good.....those who uses mobile very much men like journalist it\\'s good for them...as after full charge it\\'s battery back is too good.. i recommend anyone to buy it.. the phone is super and nice to use but only thing is phone gets heat when charging. not apart from that.... i face some problemssensor problembattery drain too fastapp hangedscreen touch show mark after click in callin manageri think u sent me a defective pice i have been using this product since a month....previously i was moto g2 .....major fault that i observed was audio clarity is slightly degraded in earphones but speakers are good....i found this because i\\'m using both g2 and k8 note.....so if music is top priority choose a another one.....if not u can go for it good. waste of money. cheater lenovo. making childish phones. good product some time hanging , battery backup is also not so good heating and network problem 1. dual stand by 4g2. not good camera [redmi note 4 has same issue]3. stock android but needs to be optimized and should have better ram/battery managementuser can choose k8 note or redmi note 4 both are fine if one ask you to choose from.redmi note 4 has plus for the miui and its customization while k8 note has bit [tiny] better on paper specs, 13mp selfi camera super camera is not good not at all recommended. my lenovo k8 has the following issues:1. poor signal strength - tried different sims like vodafone, jio, etc, but signal shows only 2-3 bars. whereas the same sims when inserted in other 4g handsets, it shows full strength n no call drops.2. heating problem: the company has added 4000 mah battery because they knew that this handset will get heated and drained battery quickly. on using simple day-to-day work, it gets heated like anything. and the full battery drains within half day. lenovo k8 note looks good, but from last morning it has started getting on/off in every second. i am not able to either switch it off or on. courier waste very very very worst battery backup is not good. mobile is so hot. it is an awesome mobile at this price. all features are awesomes. i liked it. i am utterly disappointed with the brand itself. the k series was hyped up due to its packed specifications. but this particular mobile went down the drain in less than 6 months.things i want to specify about this mobile:1. the mobile is quite heavy, not pocket-friendly2. picture quality is average for dual rear camera and the front camera isn’t good either.3. the mobile heats up real fast while watching a video or in a call.4. at some point, the turbo charging stopped working, it took forever to charge it back.5. i don’t like the resolution of the phone either.i’ve given away my mobile to the customer service, hope it survives. better not go for this mobile. the phone is good. however the bluetooth is flaky at times. in promotion they said it has gorilla glass,but today my mobile got big scrach on the screen just i kept in my pocket. this product does not have gorilla glass totally waste of money product quality is very poor and glass quality is very badbattery life is also not so good go for it! plz don\\'t by this phone waste of money awsome phone waste of money galti krdi maine isse acha to motorola ka le leta mobile it have very nice features.. one of the best smartphone under 15000 with killer performance camera and video quality is the best. good speed performance...one major drawback is camera-poor. and slightly heating... worst phone ..... heating issue, quick battery draining..very poor performance. good product in this price... everything is okay... except the heating issues..! worse than the worst mobile that i bought from lenovo.don\\'t bring this.it had no features as even in low cost mobile s not good product there was showing 2 chargers in specification but i got one battery problem still i purchase it awesome phone good in product information, maintioned 2 piece turbo charger in the box.but there is only one charger. i have purchase it but defective touchpad not working ,i requested amazon for replacement,there executive arranged the deliver person .but still i am waiting for the new one, great phone at good price !!! the 5m.p. camera is not working its only for show im not satisfied with this waste product ever very very worst mobilepeople pls don\\'t like lenovo k8 note bcs it\\'s not mobile it\\'s only used for ironing ur dress purpose only u can use this as micro oven best phone from lenovo.specialy built for performance n the screen is so smooth. camera is also best in class. the graphics processor is working like a butterfly.so good phone worth buying not the best mble, camera not that great, portrait mode is worste, better but mi a1 no internal app like music player vedio player app lock app battery app heard to take screen shot reare camera is so bad except battery backup every thing is ok charging back up is very bad.. worst phone. it takes at least 10-15 seconds to unlock thru finger print. even power button also takes few seconds to open the screen for unlock. while talking on phone, if you have to see some thing like any message, then it takes 5-6 seconds for screen lights to come up once you move it away from your ear. never buy this worst phone. operating system is pathetic. very good device in this price segment.. much better than cheap redmi phones...mediatek x23 deca core processor beats snapdragon 625 in almost every department.... amazing phone. very good battery backup up as well as clarity of camera is very good compare to other brands. good competent for vivo and in less price. touch is not working properly. battery recharge sometime slow. charging more than 5 hours is called turbo charging worst experience amazon seller kindly tacke immediate action the device kept hanging for the first couple of days and then it switched off. all attempts to switch it back were futile.received a replacement piece.not able to send vcard via sms. heavy weight... battery draining too fast.. battery charging also taking more time(5 to 6 hrs). heating problems also there while charging and internet using.some time mic also not working ever and never expected , the worst experience with lenovo and the amazon. i love it nice phone thanks team sir mera name biswajit adhikary,sir may 15.10.17 date mai lenovo k8 note liye the lekin mobile box me headphone nehi the ,too app ke paas reguest hai app muje headphone poucha dey seven months been using this phone... awesome product. only thing missing is the earphones... thats would be add on.. very good! super device good product but camera is not as per expected.. very bad mobile there is no phone which can beat it at this range.no redmi ,vivo,oppo.best i m using lenovo k8 note the phone is awesome but don\\'t buy 32 gb varient the memory gets full soo buy 64 gb varient hence forth the performance n battery life and overall the phone is good best phone at low price batteries is very bad not so good as i want from lenovo smart phone...battery charging is too much slower....nothing like turbo....if internet is on then it takes 4:30 hr to fully charged..and if internet is off still it\\'s take 3 hr to fully charged...power consumption is also not well managed ok super yesi had great expectations while buying this post review. but turned out to be a thumbs downwhile lenova k8 note comes with amazing configuration, it could not stand out to my previously used mi note 3 which i bought for 9k 2 years back. battery backup,camera features, sound quality, music and video apps , swiftness , call quality were all below average. nice mobile below 10k range.battery life is really long lasting. not lagging though i have fulled my memory n install more than 150 apps.cons. screen mirroring is only with google chrome. product quality is not as good as it describes because camera is extreme bad and phone heating problem best phone in this price range.nice camera quality. front and rear both are best at it.bright hd display.fast processing. no lagging.good battery life..go for it.!!! :) worst mobile in my life time i am not a vivid user of a lot of phones, however looking at the feature, i went for this one. as of now, i am happy with the decision. the phone does not heat up, has a great speed and camera.only feedback is to provide headphones with the pack. considering the sound output the phone delivers, user like me get confused on which phone to buy.overall, m happy with the decision. not to reach expectations very poor camera.not expected from lenovo.battery drain very fast.i brought it because i thought it could be double standard than k4.lenovo id degrading day by day. no speed dial in this phone, no inbuilt call recorder which are available in lenovo lower model, sound is not good, camera clarity is not at par as company claimed. some futures are very tough to find. battery after 15% phone shutting down. not a big deal not suggest to purchase. it\\'s heating problem while charging and updates also videos playing, battery not expecting. charging time also take time around 2 hours full . and medium speed ram work. not overall expecting compare lenovo k8+ dable camera dikhavati he wonderful camera but the turbo charger is not effective good product waste of moneyi purchased this mobile for its duel camera.but it\\'s only one rear camera is working & it\\'s quality is very poor equal to samsung\\' s 5 mp camerai want to return this product but they says its non returnablepls pls pls don\\'t buy don\\'t buy this product lots of network issue very low quality also don\\'t buy any product from amazon as it is not having any return policy no support from amazon customer support after several reminders snapdeal & flipkart are best in all support of any product this is the worst mobile phone i have bought in my life (lenovo k8 note).i recommend not to buy this product.i bought this phone on 20th august 2017, this phone is having a heating issue if you use mobile data and while playing games, heavy weight. gud thing is the camera quality.i faced a problem with the battery performance. it takes 6 - 7 hours for charging 80% battery. i approach lenovo service center, they are not able to resolve this issue, last 3 days my phone is with the service center. i tried amazon for the replacement thay are also not supporting since it this more than 10 days of purchase date.i also heard from my friend this model is having more defects the feedback he got from service center. please do not buy this product. front camera super...heating problem loved this phone my first experience with lenovo which is much better than expectations. user interface is very easy. friend don\\'t upgrade it to orio os otherwise you can face some serious problem s as heating, battery drain, not fast charge, network fluctuate, otg not supported camera quality is average not good excellent phone. smooth performance.killer audio.turbo power also excellent.full charge in 1hr 10min. earphone, tempered glass not include in the box, otherwise this phone is very good after system update mobile heatup and battery backup 4 hours. android consume most of the battery. raised complaint to lenovo but they said we tried to release update but when and how much time don\\'t know. my mi phone battery power 3000 and its 4000 but mi giving fullday and its drain 4 hours. before buy check lenovo side and see lots of comapints about phone. plz don\\'t buy this phone. functions not familiar....every time issues to connect internet ..... shortcut functions we can\\'t changed..... rear camera 5 & 13 mp but not good....lenovo given dolby system..but sound quality poor than other companies mobiles..... dolby system not good phone is good.but charge is not good bad perfamenc it is always struggled automatically switched off waste product. notification light doesn\\'t work for missed call, whatsapp messages, network signal is very feeble, sim gets disconnected frequently. don\\'t buy pls. worth the price. good before 2 months using(pcb defect )hanging problem.. mind-blowing purchase the camera could be better. v.good bad courier service...charging is very poor....or network problem this not good just that the delivery experience was not good. whereas the product is worth spending 14k very bad battery backup.i didn\\'t like this phone at all and i don\\'t even recommend others this phone.not worth good one.. no heating issues... ideal for official and non gaming purpose.. no headphones included... finding a best fit scratch guard is tough job... really a turbo charge r.. excellent product good mobile good price what are all the pro\\'s and con\\'s of this device, watch the full review vs redmi note 4 on my utube channel, denniscnlew .. also watch the durability bend test and splash test!!! but bekar amazon sarvis meri mano koi saman mt mgao isse flipcard best not good .while use the in just 15mints getting heat.battery also not good .it\\' is fastly drained.but charge is super within 30 mnts fully charged. camera is very bad, front and rear both are like cheap mobile, after oreo update, battery drain issue in 2.5 hours and turbo changer charging timing is 5 hours. heat like a electric iron, automatic restart problem, major lags sometimes. only speakers are good. fake promise of gorilla glass, as it get scratches easily.and most importantly stock android sucks, look like a idiot designed and planned for stock android.i wasted my money, you guys better go for huwai or mi, far better than lenovo and motorola.dont buy by reading paid reviews, amazing phone, worth for 12,999. good phone over all phone is good . turbo charger is not actual turbo we can it is fast charger only . phone lacks in rear camera quality . in low light performance is very poor . bhokeh effect is not working okay . if u want to buy it for photography don\\'t go for it . u can get better option cool 1 dual as better option for photography. i am using both phones phone is average. not as lenovo promised. there is no turbo charging. sometimes it lags too and camera quality is also normal. touch and screen is impressive. in my views it is just an average phone not something to hype about. head phone is missing in the box very worst product... amazon delivering unworthy items... lenovo k8 note (venom black, 4gb) best buy with maximum features & performance... so apparently, if your charger cable degrades, you have to shell out rs 1500 to replace your mobile charging port too. why you ask? because they can not connect phone to pc using \"broken\" cable (not any other working cable, because that is against their policy), so they diagnosed that charging port too must be faulty. i am amused how many ways people come up with to cheat customers. got the product within 2 days. excellent phone. the packaging could have been better. recommended for all. not working properly :- 1) not supporting word & excell files.2) battery heat up quickly & prone to life risk due to blast.3)on using any application, phone heat up immediately/quickly & battery discharges. 1> poor battery power get discharge in 24 hrs with default app running on mobile2> camera quality does not match with lenovo k4 note3> normal charging it takes minimum 2-3 hrs to charge.4>scratches on default screen guard5>no dolby effect6> had mentioned to amazon on next day but no call from amazon side7> till today no reply form amazon batery charges 40% in 1 hr with turbo charger. k5 note charges 1hr 65-75% normal charger8> refund or exchange with good one.. 90min 100% charging mobile. it takes 180 min to be 90-100%i had informed you within 10 days please do the needful as soon as possible. facing battery charging n heating issue lenovo k8 note smartphone is good. as this mobile has 4000 mah battery , but its battery is draining quickly. and there is no automatic call recorder and no voice recorder system app. good it\\'s a great phone with best features with considerable price.. best budget phone with dual camera. amazing front camera with flash. turbo charging work great. after 8.0 updates battery backup is good. gaming experience is good. no hanging. everything is perfect.. 5 star budget phone more is very slow and it takes lot of time to process. pathetic would be understatement. not recommended excellent product..... i\\'m using this phine around 10days it\\'s working good but sometimes i\\'m facing network problem so please provider tell the company to give a software update solving this problem. i came to know that 8 users out of 10 are facing network problem so it\\'s my request and its not charging as fast as written it takes 2hrs for full charging that\\'s not called fast charging i thin they haven\\'t heard the name of \"leeco le 1s eco\" which provides only 52mins im full charging and that\\'s called a fast charging and i\\'m also requesting to give a update for this and other is ok ok types.. overall if any new buyer want a featured phone then u should go for it but whose budget is 15k i think u don\\'t need to go for it..this is not as good as shown the speakers doessnot work properly ok never buy this product, speaker is not working well and amazon return facility is not working they are suggest to download another application for device testing and that application is not working.so this product make us fool.genuinely not buy this phone gud to buy with some heating related issues otherwise gud to buy nice phone ...great battery backup n camera ..thanks to amazon lenovo k8 note quality issue! very disappointed! i purchased lenovo k8 note on 18th august 2017. i was very disappointed to find that whenever i stream videos online or download videos from internet, the videos lacks sharpness and accurate colour reproduction even at higher resolutions! the videos are unwatchable! but the same videos look perfect when they are transferred to internal memory of the phone or sd card via a computer or any other storage drive. even the videos shot on lenovo k8 look perfect. the quality issue occurs only when you stream or download videos from the internet! such poor quality control from lenovo is just not acceptable! also, the led notification light doesn\\'t work with whatsapp, messenger, facebook etc. it only activates when you have an unread sms, email and missed calls. it does not work with any other app!! there is no such thing as fast charging in this phone even though it is mentioned on the box! the 4000 mah battery takes more than 2 hrs to charge and if you are using the phone while charging then it may take indefinite time to charge completely. moreover the battery drains so quickly that you may think you are using a 2500 mah battery phone. just lasts for 3/4th day even with casual to moderate use! be-aware guys if you are going for this phone be ready to compromise on video viewing quality, basic functions of led notification light, battery life and battery charging time! heating nice phone the phone screen is flickering while playing videos on youtube or while playing games... are you guys selling damaged goods in this sale? going to return the product... best phone but heats up sometimes. nice mobile but heavy compared. good product but no infrared blaster like mi for remotes. awesome piece but no usb type c port. battery is not good, it is finishing totally 100%within 2 hour of internet usage. i request to amazon to help me and solve my problem. but phone\\'s display and sound are beautiful. battery backup is very bad good phone for all new feature..but battery performance is worst compare to other mobile phone available for same prize... i suggested you that don\\'t buy lenovo product. low camera quality, lagging while doing multitasking even on whats app and facebook, and main is battery drain very fast 10-15% consume during night time while no process is running even wifi is turn off.thanks excellent mobile, smooth function, only concern is battery getting a bit hot and draining bit quickly compared to other mobiles the phone is a total let down, especially after the oreo update. it lags a lot, hangs a lot, heats a lot.turbo charging has stopped working and call quality has also dropped significantly. do not waste your money on this. i just purchased this phone 2-3 weeks ago. the look and feel of the phone is not as good as expected and not looking as brand new phone.and the major problem is heating problem phone is just getting heated when charging. which was not expected with brand like lenovo superb phone k8 note is beyond my expetions and it so faster then all other i can access all the internet websites faster.the camera was like a dslr camera. i mostly like it transferred application using share it. subsequently tried to operate the application, none of them worked. asked for return. very disappointed. nice product fast delivery one sound off & headset problem for these... particular... features..i think price.. is a bit high...try other phones which are best for this cost! one of the best budget phone to buy in around 14khave been using this phone from one month & haven\\'t received any problems in particular.sound is good & camera quality is also nice.battery back is superb & needs charging only once in whole day.selfie camera is good & along with moon light flash it works great even in low light.apps run quickly & dnt get hang in between.overall a great phone to buy. bought last month, now i noticed some heating problem and sometimes lags in performance.another big problem with bluetooth connectivity, when connected to bluetooth headset frequently disconnecting even in 1-2 feet range. and very noisy and distorted sound. this is model specific issue i checked with many other k8 note owners they all having same issue.otherwise camera good, battery lasts one day, display good, finger scanner working good so far. excellent product best mobile phone please dont buy this phone useless battery is draining and internet issue and phone is under warranty but still they are not responding properly and no exchange procedure is there and service centre is also useless i visited 2 times but my problem is not solved. its getting heat battery backup very nice overall average phone . i have been using this phone more than a month1. build quality is good2.battery backup is not up to the mark once charged 100 perc last only for 12 hrs with average usage.3. front camera is awesome , rear camera is average not better than moto g5.4.processor is not stable , there is lag in between lots of time. heating problem too much , kindly return my mobile , unable to mange shutter sound of camera too bad ,i have try to return this mobile no response from amazon.in very upsetting. the tray for sim card and micro sd card are not working. awesome... only 2 star due to poor network in this mobile.overall very good phone but for calling you have to purchase separate phone :( good phone charger is not working got it today and working very smooth and great loved the phone goof so far😀😀😀 good phone but not uptomark speaker does\\'t work....very bad experience... cam was awesome at the price range and lenovo was developed everything....jus buy it battery drains..it takes 2hrs to charge 0-90% and takes 52mins to charge from 90%-100%..but it was described that it supports fast charing..now the cost is lowered too.. poor speakers average camera not worth i m using that since 6 months did not notice any fault yet working well excellent mobile best mobile very bad very bad battery

amazon phone is pretty good.camera is outstandingok google dectection has little problembookeh mode is greatfantastic looksamazing low light selfieshonest review the smartphone heats up a lot even if very less regular use. battery is very poor, could not provide better performanc. battery lasting only for half day. by instilling some software like gomora and az screen recorder , screen goes blank compare k3 note lot of apps like call recording , screen shot are missing nice products nd am very happy..... value for money... nice device in this price section. ..performance wise it is good...camera quality is okk...features are good... go for it it is 4g+3g only not a 4g+4g dual stand by mobile. don\\'t get deceived by the lenovo claim.only either sim1 or sim 2 slot supports lte feature.the other one becomes 3g or 2 g. fantastic mobile don\\'t install all apps use only limited apps otherwise mobile will be hang up super mobile. good battery backup. duel camera is good. front camera amazing. nice product with killer look and feature. not bad perfect delivery. till now no glitches heating issue while charging bakwaas phone h plz don\\'t buy dual sim has 4g option on one sim & 3g on another. both are not 4g. think before purchase. good phone...but the rear camera is the only disappointment...i doubt if dual camera really works or not...coz picture is not up to expectation...front camera is too good much better than rear camera...rest with other features...the phone is good enough the phone is ok but since december 25th,the jio network calls&messaging did nt work.the service centre here in chennai informed me that the os is old one & has to be upgraded to get the jio work properly.hence,i would like a replacement for the phone as it is within the 6 months period having purchased in august,2017 first of all would like to say that amazon gives amazing delivery service..about the phone i would say its damn good masha allah... u can go for it. it really is a killer phone.. i am reviewing about this phone after the use of 6 months and is still my favourite.. there is no problem with it at all. it really dissatisfying to not getting earphone for lenovo k8 note. it must be provided by lenov, it\\'s not expected from amazon and lenovo, it\\'s not written anywhere that box not contain earphone. i spend 13k and didn\\'t got earphone is really disappointed me. battery life is not good.screen is so smooth.user experience is smooth. apps hang frequently, it\\'s depth enable mode is not good, battery drained fast. awesome product. not sure about other features ... but the battery backup is poor. atleast lenovo could not maintain the same level of quality in this product. i purchased the one .. and after a week found ~30% battery drain overnight when the phone was completely idle. it stared draining 8 to 10% in 10 mint of usage. called customer care ... they connected the device via smarttest app and noted the problem. thanks to amazon ... within couple of days they replaced and delivered a new one. the same story repeated again ... this time they arranged a technician visit ... as per his report amazon scheduled the pick up and arranged the refund. thanks amazon for wonderful customer service. now im really scared to buy such things from stores. im sure they will not take it back and will advise me to go to service center. superb camera performance is not good product is excellent but in box i am not get ear phone. disappointing very very poor charging backup,and very over warming over heating in game😥 nice nougut version overall ok but i receive the oreo update very very poor performance highly very over heating issue and battery quickly trained so much charging time so delay and not working in fast charging , very slowly working in os and so many hanging problem in my phone ... lenovo y this is problem pls reactifi the problem pls help me or exchange my phone or not... this phone put electronic waste ...., any one lenovo costumer care number send me . pls. never buy any lenovo mobile... request to new customer. we purchased three mobiles for family. a7000 k3 note and a6000. all mobiles are bakwas.... touch problem hangup and become hot are common problem. and bad news is that motorola company take over by lenovo. so motorola product may be become bad due to lenovo. lenovo pls sell grocery instead of electronics. the camera was very bad. i find my what\\'s aap and facebook app crashes many time. i face many time problem while receiving calls.but the installation speed is amazing. i can say that phone has good batry backup but not the best. phone is not hanged any time but apps crashes many time very nice looking mobile with metallic finish, everything is awesome, battery back up is goodvalue for money except that if you want camera quality then it is average internal memory was showing 64gb but in file manager its showing 51gbheating problem also good phone but picture quality is not so good compared to my redmi note 3 which is an old phone. images taken are sometimes elongated or out of shape. flash in selfie cam is not good as well.both rear and selfie cam have image quality issues due to the camera lens very bad experience..sim slot is not working super awesome experience, superb sir eska bill chehre the product is really awesome thank you amazon for your get service not

is the contact list is completely jumbled, i call a person and and you hear a different person answering the call.only good thing is charges very fast and as of now stays for the whole day nice mobile now it is good not bad one of the speaker is not workingeven battery is not up to the mark.not happy at all i am not a big fan of lenovo, but i was compelled to buy this product due to its specs at a reasonably low rate and i was correct lenovo has done nly one thing rite to quire motorola and that can only save them. i am using lenovo k8 note for past 1 month andi have started getting issues like heating , at times too slow for the basic use itself. these cons can be accepted but for the past few days i am getting issues with charging, it cahrges for few minutes then automatically it stops. really a bad experience with phone with usage of 1 month only [initial review: 22-aug-2017]i\\'ve been using this phone for last 3 days, so this is kind of initial review. buying experience and delivery was crisp thanks to amazon prime, amazing.1. the design is not a eye catcher, but nothing wrong about it either2. the camera is ok and nothing impressive. low light photography is grainy3. heating is a serious problem. it gets hot after long usage. not unbearable, but not desirable either4. os is nice and close to stock. addition of some moto s/w makes it even better5. no lag or performance issue so far4. display is good but on the dimmer side. would loved to see a brighter display6. battery back up and fast charge work fine7. sound through good earphone is above the price rangeverdict: before jumping into conclusion you might want to consider lg q6 and to be launched nokia 6 or better redmi note4                                                                                       [update#1 : 25-aug-2017]it\\'s been a week since i\\'m using this. below is the update in addition to my initial review.1. the phone battery drains fast compared to the capacity and it hardly lasts a day2. the bokeh effect is not something worthy, lot of manual stabilization and patience is required to get a good shot3. heating problem continues and it seems a permanent issue4. poor os optimization and thus not suitable for heavy gaming, plus the heating issue5. works fine with jio volte, both for calls and dataverdict: hype is not delivered. good it is super this phone has heating issue in only 10 days from purchase date. very very poor product by lenovo . it hasn\\'t been working at all. i purchased less then a month before it\\'s not working at all...... i have never been believed lenovo not gonna do so.it is the worst experience ever in my life with a new phone.lenovo is fake company.battery doesn\\'t even last 10 with easy usage .graphics is not good as adreno.so totally it\\'s a worst phone no call recorder one cannot select. all contacts at once good phone best phone tq lenovo super, good in use device is good but rate is too high.my relative purchased in flipkart for 8999 only.. never going to buy again from lenovo excellent performance. quite happy with the product. battery lasts for more than 24 hours inspite of heavy usage. camera performance is also very good. all you have to do is adjust some settings in the camera app. no lag no hang so far. screen resolution is beautiful. writing this review after using the phone for more than a month now. go for it guys. really hate this it comes with gorilla glass which can break esasyly. even in low pressure on it. k4 note users don\\'t buy this as this is not an upgrade of k4 note. this interface is different and many features which are in k4 note are missing in this. very good product. nice smooth performance. thanks mediatek for high speed processor. those who ever wants can buy with out hesitation. phone good with good features but not having a headphone with it is the biggest turn-offs. that just seems cheap on lenovo\\'s part not to add in the headphones. the fm application is useless without the headphones. good mobile at good price better than my expectations, amazing! battery backup is poor good camera quality liked the product, everything is good as per a budget smartphone. frustrated with the brand lenovo. heating issue is the main problem here. also, this handset keeps asking for some version update but if you click on update, without updating itself it gets restarted. seems a defective item i have received. have not explored much yet as i was relatively upset and screwed up due to these issues. heating problem a good hand set according to this price video saturation problem.camera is not good as expected very good nic phone stylish fone! speed is satisfactory. but the problem is software.the speaker automatically switch on on call. also there is problem in headphone jack. after use of headphones the speaker and microphone do not work. the phone needs to be restarted. i want exchange my mobile. i like to buy one+6 very good phone.... recieved in 3 days ...using it since 30 days and found no problems in my phone..best thing i like is split screen ...we can use 2 things at a same time ..liked it very much👍👍 camera clarity, battery, all functions are good.. best option to purchase... affordable 👍 very bad product , after 10 days of use this product hangging continuously. yeh mo bahut jaldi garam ho ja raha h battery back up jyada nahi hai redmi ke apeksha . mobile is getting heat while charging.... phone is good.!! but when u are usingbphone while charging it takes 7hrs to full chagre..!! ans battery drain too quickly absolutely best product from lenovo.it would be better snapdragon processor must be placed instead of mediatek pros1.stock android2. faster updates3. very fast installation4. comparatively fast and responsivesmooth.5. speaker on this phone is awesome6. dolby atmos7. headphone output (bit above avg)8. design looks very poor.cons1.depth mode is marketing gimmick,2.fixed focus front camera,3.both camera lenses are very poor quality very poor camera performance,4.os needs lot of stabilization, below 15% battery , the phone starts behaving very weirdly!(i guess it\\'s due to power saving mode)5. display quality is poor . killer lookkiller camerakiller 360° sound by dolby atmosawesome gaming performancei have been using it for the last 9 months and pubg and asphalt 8 play together but never got hanged.😎 nice phone everything is ok phone heating too much while charging and voice calling. not a good phone as per specifications. quick charge discharge.. & turbo charger is not working after 5 days nice battery is not preforming good good one don\\'t buy this phone cast screen is not supported ok too good i have ordered recently this products. everything is in the phone is fine but the

quality is very bad. outstanding amazing performance...... not good camera ,poor sound quality and some times phone heating otherwise good only thik thak no cast screenno built-in galleryno built-in sound recorderdump waste lenovo having best features with 64 gb internal and 4 gb memory with superb camera clarity. only problem heating and battery for less hours. best product of lenovo good....worth buy... best in the market just not detecting the second sim card... will try a few days and see if it works or i have to return... amazon was good with delivery and package handling

very worst mobile pls don\\'t buy. network issues the smartphone is excellent in all respect, very little bit of heating issue is there for all such phones. a phone to choose. my experience is very bad. it is not charging. purchased on 1 jan 2018 very worst phone battery life is too poor. battery decrease while it is not in use got lenovo k8 note intake box today.thank u amazon.but inside box only 1pcs 15w charger 1pcs data cable 1pcs hand set.no any head phone or no extra one 15w charger.when i purchase that time say the description 2pcs 15w charger in box.pls send me feedback for head phone and charger. mobil process is really super and camera front and back clearly photo great phone at this price range i used both redmi note 4 and lenovo k8 notethe k8 note is really a xiaomi killer camera quatlity is not upto the mark very bad product full mobile heat it\\'s like iron box don\\'t waste your money by purchasing this mobile dear amazon / lenovo,i purchased this phone as a gift for my father who is 70+ yrs hoping that the large screen and its ease of operation would help him. right from the start after receipt of the phone my father kept complaining that there is a problem with the phone as screen does not respond / wake up (if locked) or notify an incoming call; so he is only able to hear phone ring but not able to receive the call. i thought it was a settings issue but when we took to lenovo service center at prime mall, irla, vile parle (w), mumbai on 18 oct 2017 the service center representative said that we should have returned the product in 15-days and then took in phone for software reload. my father spent rs 700 for backing up & reloading data. after this software reload the product worked ok until 27 oct 2017 and then the same incoming call issue has reoccurred.now my father who is 70+ yrs old is sick of this phone and this problem and doesn’t want it.kindly assist in the matter please. i received phone quickly & short time... good work.. camera awesome. touch perfomance good.sound quality is best. but where is defaut gallery? where is clipboard? where is defaut music player? too weight(190gram). this product doesn\\'t meet all the expectations it created at the time of launching.1. processor and camera is good. no buffering while watching videos in you tube / live tv / dedicated portals of tv network.2. trendy look, easy handling and lenovo could have provided headsets in the accessory kit. that was missing!!!!3. turbo charging was good initially after couple of months it started deteriorating from its set standards. it takes time min of 1.30 hrs for 20% when the battery capacity is at 80%.4. battery life is not as expected for 4000 mah. for a non gamer with limited default apps it should last for more than a day when used fully under mobile data. but battery drains out quickly.5. ear piece volume: there is a problem in all lenevo mobiles that, while on call near by person can hear the voice of other person. its very pathetic when it comes to whatsapp calling. it gives us a feel, like we put our mobiles on speakers. the volume is too loud even though the same is kept at least level. lenovo technical team should pay more attention on this set back.6. audio output : could feel dolby atmos effect only when we keep our palm near speakers. else this feel is missing completely. its because of single outgo at the bottom of the device due to which this feature got misfired i believe. tested this feature specifically with dolby atmos effect videos which is widely available in web pages.7. otherwise, got this mobile on deal. so when compared with other models i got the device for what i have paid for. i should compromise myself in that way.8. could feel heating issues when mobile data is used continuously for more than 25 minutes or during on a call for more than 15 minutes.hope this review helps. i received damage phone please arrange returned k8 note is good but some problem in volte, when phone in idle mood i couldn\\'t receive any incoming calls via jio sim. please lenovo team fix this problem as soon as possible. do not buy this product worst battery backup battery discharges very soon. performance of the product is also very slow.as u will expect about the phone it will not be on your desires. completely satisfied with the product and its been over 5 months now and devise is working pretty smooth, also appreciate the service level from amazon. the camera is not that great as you think i would say it’s normal and good for elderly a very nice phone... love the stock anroid system as it has no preinstalled apps. just one thing that the phone heats but i guess it is normal. good product, @ best price ..first the charging adapter is not working and i have send the request of replacement then replacement is confirmed and second time when phone is delivered instead of mobile accessories there are 3 stones in the boxes... worst experience..... simply waste product and not working ... no service centre giving proper reason and not giving proper service. battery problem.except that it\\'s nice. good mobile with great features, but gallery is misssing it is good quality.... delivery was good.there was no headset in the box. good phone nothing bad about it but im also using honor 7x its better in this price segment but notk8 is also awesome it\\'s processor is like having a gaming pc in your phone.highly recommend for buying.can multi task buttry smooth. phone is awesome, buy worth it 1,processor speed performance low signal reciving,download, app open.taking time2, camera quality low rear 5mp camera working or not working , not identify it,3, shots caputring only 13 mp camera only than what is the function of 5 mp camera, it working like a sensor.. ? measuring the depth only..?4, speaker and mic quality good.5, full,charging stand by with net 6 hrs only6, heating issue compared to other ph less only7, mobile weight more compared to other mobi8,touch screen response good9, charging speed good,totally don\\'t expecting more.. against this lenovo k8 showing specifications ..budget mobile only 4 gp ram ,64 gp romin this product box not available ear phone, its a good phone. simple but more effectively woww great mobile... worth the price... i suggest everyone to buy this phone... lenovo k8 note rocks... guyz dnt by lenovo mobile..they worst after sales services..from top to bottom all peoples are recless in lenovo...n this phone is total wasteage of money.. worst front camera.it\\'s an avg smart phone. does not support google now launcher. poor camera quality. the camera does not provide the clarity it should be for this mp. awesome mobile but lacking with auto brightness mode bad experience.please don\\'t buy this mobile.its a degraded version of lenovo k series,even worser than k3 or even cheaper models.camera has blur ,poor video quality.no proper response from amazon and lenovo till date.no upgrade to remove even basic problem s.i think amazon and lenovo looted with a cheap phone using lenovo brand name.motorola is a flop company and this particular model is made from motorola factory and not lenovo. best good product quality is good,battery backup is fantastic. excellent product. worth buying jack of all it is at this cost good one in this range..... superb. product product is faulty. re-boot automatically several times.need replacement of this hand set. good product phone is good but don\\'t by now as there r more options.battery drains like micromax which is not expected in lenovo perhaps the high end display has resulted this.if ur darling is ur smartphone then i m sorry to say she can run for only 6 hours continuously.so think wisly n heartly before taking this.there is no problem of overheating.dual app settings is not available a big disappointment if u use that. there r no head phones with u have to buy that urself worest phone in world, battery drains quickly,volte not working properly,if on battery saver from prevent battery,volte not working, fingerprint scanner is very slow,bad camera quality.i want returned this phone but i got bad response from amazon,so don\\'t buy this phone awesome phone in such a price..really like it.delivered on time and nice packing .no issue till now, phone is working fine. lenovo k8 note is very good phone . the phone is quite excellent and is as described; a great budget phone with all required functionalities! would recommend to friends for future purchase. phone is good but battery is not good, battery overheating. please where lenovo mobile gallery? i m stay malad west. got this phone delivered today and i was not completely impressed by it.the pros:absolute fine display.good camera quality.great finishing to the body work.comes with transparent body cover.dual sim and micro sd can be used altogether.charge speed/power backup is best in class.the cons:no earphones.has dolby atmos but no audiophile sound. (not as loud and clear as k4 note and vibe x3 with earphones). not suited for music enthusiasts at all.stock android 7.1 version is rugged and not so user friendly. too many settings are replaced and are annoying to navigate through.overall, a decent phone at great price considering the hardware package being offered. 1) i bought this for dual camera but the deep effect was not not good.2) battery life awesome after a month usage , this phone sucks nice phone power battery fasst charging no heating problem product is good, on time delivery, ear piece is not available.overall good yes its good great phone get sound get brand.. good battery life , average look ,smooth performance , i purchased this mobile at republic day sale. as always they reduced mobile prices and sold it. the beauty is, those mobiles should have any defect like heating, bluetooth problems. so now you can understand why they give extra discount on this mobile. so don\\'t purchase mobiles that has been having a extra discount on any great indian sale.the bottom line, don\\'t purchase mobiles from amazon. not satisfied heating issue while charging, now hanging many times, battery backup less in box no headset ok mobile with very basic operations. touch is good and so is camera. but nothing else is so great. it has very limited functionality compared to my old sony mobile. and it doesn\\'t come with earphone which is strange. i am thinking to sell it and buy another one, may be moto or nokia. heavy heat divice and no battery back up your service is very good am rating 5star but handset 30 minutes use heavy heat help you bahut hi ghatiya mobile 5min hit ho jata hai it doesn\\'t support volte feature. not better phone... camera not good .... battery drain fast ... heating issuehow i can do this

lenovo k8 note. i think it was one of the worst product i ever use. there are so many issues with this product. the battery backup is mazor issue. on the box it has 4000 mah battery . but it was drained maximum 5 - 6 hours in normal condition. its annoying . the phone has two big issues also - 1. heating issue 2. hang issues. only the phone camera is good. it is the worst smartphone i ever use. i dont want use this product kindly return it and give my money back. satisfied after 2 month when i charge my phone it will be heat .... lenovo ki note nice looking, but network catch not better than redmi note 4. average heating problem. nice product doesn\\'t look like gorilla glass. broke multiple times lenovo k8 note is the perfect mid range phone.plus it has got stock android and regular updates.i bought the 4 gb variant (venomous black)pros-1.stock android2.good display (big display)3.good design4.nice speakers5.decent front and back camera (ill come to the second camera later)6.can play resource intensive games easily7.has no dirty skins for andoid so the performance is mid blowing for a mid ranged variant.8. awesome costo what i think , this phn is excellent. but in just 15 days mobile is heating very high whenever i charge or switch on the internet, mobile is heating. very bad experience. missing the pin to open the sim card must buy mobile phone and good service by flipkart i am used 7 month mobile lenovo k8 note is very good phone and smart .my phone apdated but my phone android 8.0 verson and taken time my mobile android 7.1.1 very very nice my phone camera is not having good additions in it awesome performance.super battery life.super rear and front camera clarity.awesome gaming experience.completely price worthy product. worst mobile, heats up, battery drains out in 2 hours use, takes 10 hours in charging. money wasted nice cell phone its, good but i am not available to understand how works dual camera because i checked by finger touch on camera, but i think uper camera is not working. so we how to say dual camera phone. other wise its ok volte option doesn\\'t work while in power saving mode. other than that the phone works fine i will not recommend this phone . its battery back up is poor and video quality doesn\\'t match with the same end phones.i want to suggest buyers who are planning to buy this phone don\\'t buy this ,, instead of k8 note go for k8 plus ..k8 plus and k8 note has small difference in specs but very big differences in performance. k8 plus has good battery life and last for almost 1 day after heavy use (in my case)., k8 note has same 4k mah battery but drains very quickly.gaming experience quite nice on k8 plus and k8 note both..no lags. k8 note has some heating issue while charging but k8 plus has very minor or no heating problems.i have both the phones and among both of them k8 plus seems good to me.thank u. a real great phone. fully developed lenovo technology. good to buy this. dual camera is not working any way good amazon services is good looks and works good.but consumes lot of bactory.need to charge twice a day. i saw 2 problems in mobile. 1) i found no gallery in mobile 2) it takes too much time to delete pics from file manager. rest lenovo k8 note is wonderful great smoother phone but sometime hit and camera quality average no voice and call record options i lost my phone within 1 week in goa. and goa police (calangute police station )don\\'t support to search my phone. price low why.. i bought 13999 nd 5 days after it 11999 battery quality and back up is really awesome.camera quality is also good.screen resolution is attractive.buttons are a bit hard but fine enoughspeaker quality is above par.really nice buy option among budget phones. best mobile in this price am not get 15%off discount... the phone hangs and restarts...apparently it is something to do with the software update... quite ridiculous because one would expect the phone to perform better with an update when the memory is half unused and that there are not many applications awesome mobile at this price, good battery backup, super camera clarity & flash on both front & back, huge memory (64gb inbuilt & 4gb ram) & also dedicated memory card slot, dual sim, every thing is good. but tempered glass is not fit for the curved finish display, so can be rated 4. everything thing is perfect but it is having 2 major problems,1. secondary camera and boke effect is zero performance, it\\'s nothing there just a marketing strategy.2.bluetooth is not working properly, getting struck while playing audio through bluetooth and even when we switch the bluetooth on it won\\'t connect fast it will tries to connect all other devices which are not in range(have connected in past) if we click on particular bluetooth device also it won\\'t responds correctly.plz try to rectify it..otherwise it\\'s a very good product for this price.! nothing to go awww with the specs, neither the phone is dud.music & camera- nothing exciting, music is strictly ok, camera is decent.software- few glitches in the software, we cant see the battery percentage, no provision for night eye care view. (k6 note had)gaming- avoid if you are a gamer and like to play for 2-3 hrs daily. phone gets heat up above 40 degrees. also, i saw lags in phone while playing basic games.speed- if multiple applications are runned, than there is chance that phone will get slightly slow.display- superb, at this price tag.overall review- nice phone, but could have been way better had lenovo used sd625 chipset, they should not had compromised on chipset.still, not a bad purchase,, just get your priority right.update- please don\\'t buy this device that is my humble request to all value for money.good product. the in-box accessories had earphone missing in it. nice way to cheat 1000 rs from customers. never expected this. worst. looking nice,great camera but battery is bad. & set is being over heat... pricing issue, device is not up to the expectation. battery backup is very worst.....really am very disappointed for this phone ......memory for 4gb ram and 64gb internal memory and separate memory card slot is good.....all specifications r good except battery .... phone is working gr8........... happy i\\'m writing this review after using the mobile for 1 month. b4 this phone i have used k3note that was far better in performance than this mobile. it\\'s worth buy if you get it below 10k. not recommended for 12k+. very bad excellent this mobile is same as other mobile. this mobile having hanging problem, and it is heating like a cooker while i turn on the wifi or mobile data. and the camera quality is not as much good. nothing special. disappointed the expectations worst phone i never seen this type of phone. if i use this phone continuous 15 minutes getting heat. battery capacity mentioned was 4000 mah but its value is 1000 mah. worst battery backup. no default music application and no default gallery application. i recommended you people don\\'t purchase. if we go service center no proper response from those guys. nice and this feature are already in the moto. but in this less gesture, but ok best mobile at this price.no complaints.i don\\'t want to go to technical side.but as for pure mobile user it is best. good product.value for money. heating issue, display issue, etcoverall the phone is not good.....want to replace it worst worst worst....product of the universe short of words. simply amazing look. works smoothly. camera is amazing. i m using from last 4 day but mobile is getting heating problem and battery life also not good. good mobile my usefull is phone pe network ka bhout bada problem hai.... awesome shandaar vry well smartphone this product was awesome and good performance than i expected nice product so far good the worst piece we didn\\'t get earphones in this pack problem if you update to oreo best mobile ever , best performance of camera processor also very fast and battery performance also good ridiculous phone. absolute terrible that amazon sells this heat pad as a phone. it heats up first time you charge it. has a billion bugs. so disappointed had to sell mine immediately after buying. deca core but still lags. network issues. jio sim issues. heavy at 180 grms. cant get over the bad experience i had. please save yourself the trouble and dont buy it. i am using this phone over a 3month and i am facing to much of problems like1 worst battery backup2 loss of so many features3 if u had a brain better don\\'t buy this product very poor battery!!! does not even last for a full day on normal usage. the 4000mah battery on the redmi 4 lasts for two days almost with normal usage. this phone is definitely not comparable to the redmi 4. this is no \\'killer\\' note. the supposed to be fast/turbo charger is a normal charger. takes over 3 hours to charge the battery from 15 to 100%. disappointed totally nice phone worst phone 😡 worst battery performance duplicate product,very worst product worth product heating and lags even in day to day uses.battery drain very fast, i unplugged it at 8am and i have to replug it at 5pm and i\\'m a normal user never play games. it\\'s... awesome..it\\'s camera , android,size,color,sound, everything. in this is fab ..😍😍 ausome product & delivery service camera quality is superb.battery perfm. is good.problem is it heat up after a 30-60mins net surfing or playing high graphic games previously i had oppo f1s that ran games smoothly and it had 3 gb of ram. this k8 note has 4 gb of ram but games like (war robots) is lagging in this phone. i feel very bad for buying this phone. worst after installation of recent update the phone is heating up very fast and the battery goes down in a jiffy from 100 to 0 i think the update is faulty same problem is seen in all k8 notes nice phone there is no headphones with the device and no option to use a customized ringtone. you have to use the pathetic and irritating ringtones and alarm from this device. very very disappointing. great battery great performance and front flashlight was cool...but it depth camera not work properly... nice phone lenovo k8 note (venom black, 4gb)i am very upset when i face network related issue in this handset, i generally use idea! network that is my amazon linked mobile number when i inserted micro sim it has worked instantly but since 3 days i didn\\'t connect to anyone else via calling.1. network signal up & down.2. sometimes signal not showing.3. didn\\'t connect call generally i tried more than 2 times.4. but all other things very good like software & configuration.5. design not good as compare to other. nice mobile very fast everything is best pros:i purchaseed the 4gb/64gb variant..delivery was fast,device got deliverd one day before the promised timecons:signal reception issue on airtel4g,, im missig all my calls since i placed my airtel sim card to lenovo k8 note,, that too when im using a single primary sim and other slot is empty..tried restarting/aeroplane mode on off, spoke to airtel customer care alreadynever faced such issues on my previous honor6charging the device takes too much time almost 3 hours from 10 to 100% ,only charges fast is the phone is off.going to sell the device on olx if amazon or lenovo dont provide any solution to signal reception soon.back camera quality is too poor,forget the dual camera usage even on singal back cam the images are blurry and takes time to focusexpected better for a 13999 fone from lenovo don\\'t buy k8. software bugs.this is my 1st negative feedback. there are issues with notifications. contacted tech support team to whom even making the problem understood is a herculean task.. so you can forget about resolution. only answer available is \"escalating, team work, shall revert at earliest\". hope we all know what such responses mean. i am disgusted with lenovo. they claimed k8 to be killer..yes it would kill your want to use smartphone !!!don\\'t waste your time and money on a half cooked phone released in hurry to counter nokia.i repent buying it and thought it prudent to warn the fraternity of potential buyers.rajiv pathakrajivpathak27@gmail.com nice and excellent working on it. it\\'s an amazing product at this price. the only thing i found lacking is the internet connectivity and the battery back up. though it claims to have 4000 mah back up but with frequest browsing and talking it gets exhausted very fast. there is no lagging the phone responds to your type request very fast and the google assistant is saviour. over all a good phone to go ahead with. there was only one charger in the box, where as they mentioned dual chargers of 15w. amazing.. missing asseseris with this mob turbo charging not working happy with oreo update mobile configuration is gud i m very happy with this mobile a good ph to have. atleast at this price range.even good when offers are going on. at that time price comes down significantly. abysmal network reception. very nice product ..build by lenovo...lov it this is very nice mobile i like it very much with that features best mobile & good service by amazon the touch needs to be worked upon. the camera is gud and the display quality is also gud. value for money in this price range. 👎 the battery gets drained a little quickly rest all good basic voice recorder is not available. i am not satisfied with this. i will return this item. superb phone.best in class features with dolby atoms.. this is a genuine review: 1: heating issue, 2: no option for call recording,3: no option for how to show your contacts 4: 3.5 jack and charging options are in top and bottom not in a good placement, 5: storage data from sd card also not proper; 5: no shortcut key for vibration and location on/off and to take screenshot... camera quality also not good... unhappy with k8 note... awesome phone no hanging issue... 👍 good product poor camera quality, too much heating!!! not recommended... nice mobile worst mobile ever first six months was good and then comes charging and heating issues even using of the original charger charging takes 3 -4 hours to get fully charged and even gets heated with the mobile switched off and kept in charge the main problem comes with the heating, evening for normal browsing it gets heated if you play a video game it will get heated to hell never seen such a heat by any mobile camera is poor battery getting low with in 1 hour and mobile getting heat one of the best phone very nice thanks to lenovo for such a nice phone works great no issue and trouble free and thanks for the music key very useful. no chutia phone the mobile is hanging every now and then. on 18 oct 17(purchased on 09 aug 17) the phone totally gone dead and not booting. consulted service centre and was intimated that the software failed and got the mobile after reloading the software. for two days the mobile worked fine, but now again the phone is getting hanged and rebooting on its own. don\\'t know whom to consult and get a replacement of the mobile. very bad show on the part lenovo and amazon for supplying under qulaity products. very good mobile , good battery backup and wonder full rear dual camera , i m totally satisfied from this product. got this phone with so much of expectations... but it\\'s not to the level.. mi note 4 is much better than this ... dual cameras seemed to be taking stunning pics.. but it\\'s not good.. selfie cam also may be done better... this phone is just satisfying.. not so good... superb mobile phone awesome product. performing good... finger print is not working properly excellent nice features worth buying. best smartphone under 15k..high quality camera and better processer. form new up date installed time , the mobile strucks and stop apps suddenly very lagy , lonovo contact is did not possible so i hope stellar is help to me and , send to e new update solution i hope ok dear sir,lenovo k8 (fine gold) this mobile one side sound speaker is not working.please send me new mobile. no gallery and battery problems i am experiencing in my k8 note and heating issues display is cracking but not returning overall ,good.major problem is heating issue when playing high definition game.. execellent phone for the price.the curved glass surprised me as the shop wala tried to put the tempered glass screen guard as it did not sit on the edges. gud mobile except the earphone socket, which is not remarkable. overall gud but not too gud. i bought this product from a flash sale on amazon in august 2018. it\\'s been just 7 months and this 13999 mobile with 4gb ram behaving like some cheap product it switch off automatically 8-10 times a day. twice i have been to the service center but the problem persist. they say it\\'s ok now and i face the same problem the very same day. now i m trying to get it exchange with any other phone and i m getting 2700 offer from amazon. wow not good product. only battery is good. bluetooth is very bad this phone doesnt feel like a 4000mah phone. even my lenovo vibe k5 note gave better backup than k8 note.the ram doesnt feel like a 4gb ram either. even when you dont have any apps running, the ram usage is high.price wise this is decent. but there the specs on paper and the performance dont match up with each other.unless lenovo optimise the performance and send in an update, my recommendation would be \"dont buy\" lenovo phones are worst.i and my relative used lenovo phones 6 times .but all are worst in touch sensor.and hardware don\\'t buy this mobile...battery drainage#easily get hot#poor camera..... very good good phone and working great so far.. delivered on time and good service mobile betteryy is very bad ... work only 10hr only good phone with trustworthy service centres good one good performance.. good versatile phone with great value for

......desply superb .battary good .far better thn redmi y good features good i can\\'t expect lenovo to produce a product like garbage. lenovo k8 note is just worst phone so far. k4 note was much better in design and performance which i used last before k8. network issue is one and hotspot issue is second big problem. i am unable to find network even sometimes at open places. and hotspot do not work when you want to connect it with laptop.so be careful is you are considering this handset.also rear camera is garbage.hell. good product wifi is not working battery life not as expected.

while internet data enable to sim1 slot, only received when data enable to sim2. not help received from customer care. dont buy lenovo phones. good camera is not up to the remarkable. battery is not working properly. the cheapest price with good features better than g5 s plus very worst product from lenovo...1. phone gets heating even if the phone is in idle state2. sleep timer is note working3. battery is draining like anything. even after a full charge, the battery is coming to 5% within afternoon. very worst phone :--- pls don\\'t buy this phone1. camera quality worst2. battery drains fast3. phone heats4. turbo charging takes 3 hours to reach 100 % in switch off condition5. gorilla glass quality not good --mobile fell down from 1 feet height ,gorilla glass just broke off . i am getting battery issue now after system update. even i charging same in the morning with 100%, but by noon the charging coming down to 20% !!! also the mobile is getting too much heated now. require replacement as covered under warranty. full network problem don\\'t take this one.... very good product... gorilla glass is fake my phone is broke and its my phone\\'s battery backup and camera quality is not also good 3 month after mobile problem.... camra, battery, sound,& speed all function is perfect good phone, camera is awesome both in front and back.. battery lost for one day if we on 4g received it today, the first thing i noticed that there was no earphone in the box. second thing phone is heating too much in normal use and while charging it heats up more, also the screen seems to be have some problem as the colors are not clear on screen.i see some blue shades on screen onevery picture, app, and other screens. super pros:good batterystock androidvery smoothcons:bad dual camera (probably a fix with software update)sometimes overheats pros :-- good operating speed- sufficient battery life and speakers- satisfying display quality- front camera s goodcons :-- rr camera is not up to the expectation ( cannot feel the impact of dual cameras) and picture quality is very poor- not smart enough - very limited customization options- lack of some basic apps ( gallery , music players etc..) nice product with best packaging not so good many main features are missing like1 call recording and not third party app support2 blair effect in camera not so good3 auto screen sleep when flip cover used4 not satisfied with front flesh light5 take much time with other charger (lke usb power bank) expect charger with that6 screen too good7 multiple windows a good feature in that one8 speakers only lower side strep and dolby average9 overall average and upgrade model leg from previous numbers like k4 note10 honor 9i is batter one the delivery was good which as usual from amazon. but, the phone screen glass is very fragile. it is not the break resistant. i had my phone a small fall from about 2 ft and the glass broke. to replace, i have to shell out about 5k. i haven\\'t expected this from the so called gorilla glass. it is not gorilla glass 3 gen and hence be careful. it is not meant for even little rough use. after two days of receiving the device started acting up. touchscreen went wrong apps started opening automatically. if you press one digit several other digits automatically pops out.. don\\'t buy this phone i am asking for replacement but i don\\'t knw the replaced device will be ok or not.. don\\'t buy lenovo phones.. *review continue* #2.09.17.. i got the replaced product and its more horrible battery is not at all getting charged.. its taking 8 hours to charge 70%.. and after browsing for 10 mins battery will drain very fast and the phone becomes a fireball..so finally i have asked for refund.. and thanks to amazon that they too agreed for the same... recieved just now,,,, i\\'m fully satisfied with this mobile, thanks to amazon for your great delivery... after a few days left side speaker stopped working... all of a sudden. i didn\\'t think i will be delivered such defective products from amazon. really disappointed ! bluetooth audio has intermittent noise.. battery of 4000mah only is good for numbers, not in terms of long lasting device operation.poor power management to blame. my earlier mi max 2 with 5300mah gives 3 days battery. this one if it was equally good in power management should give at least 2 days, but barely lasts a day . don\\'t buy this goog its awsome. worth product the phone is good nice best mobile gud but as we know little of radiation but very nicely working best monile ever sheet i simply brought ths phn its geting heat if use if fr 15 min m getng worried if it is get blashed on ma hand thn wt i supose to do?? ok charging cable is of poor quality. within 2 months of purchase , it was not charging . service centre in bangalore did not give free replacement during warranty period on flimsy ground of liquid damage. all contacts in cable should be water/moisture proof for robust qulality. think twice before buying . product is good but no battery backup, it gives only for 12hours charging mobile battery dragging. not charging as discrb 1) very poor camera quality,2) caller list not able to delete in any way, as usually in basic phone having called list edit or delete option.3) messages not able to support for sent but receiving is ok4) even hidden calls showing in the caller list5) voice record option is not available6) unknown or unwanted caller id or caller no in the caller list is not possible to delete - which is most drawback in this phone, as usually all have the ambition not to shown our contacts or immediate deleting process in the caller is not available even editing option is not available immediate from the caller list7) battery drain fast8) phone outlook is good but features is not goodin my opinion this phone is very worst and suggest not to buy k8 note, see other lenovo brand instead of thissrinivas kopilla, hyderabad ordered for frnd... awesome phone good. very good product far lenovo not worth good mobile in best pricerear camera is good compared to front one.vr mode is goodaccessing is fast as it has 4gb ramfinger print response is quickoverall satisfied with this budget phone,, 👌👌👌👍 excellent product... good handset at this price with dual rear camera with descent pics quality.sound quality is good.battery backup little low as compared to redmi note 4. no screen shot option on toggle and no add contact option in msg settings. had trouble while operating msgs. bought it on the first sale been using it for the past two days battery backup is good on moderate use. coming to the camera it is just about ok using depth focus makes photos look like they are photoshopped. os is a bliss to use if u like pure android experience. the charger is making a slight hum u can hear some noise when turbo charge is on, i am slightly skeptical about using it, will it blast i don\\'t know, for now i am gonna continue using it.... having high network issue not a quality build... some nice feature but rear camera is worst. very good product...till logs on heavy and high graphics game...good camera quality...battery is awesome...performance is very smooth...and time to time i got updates for the phone..... nice phone good camera fast charging excellent battery backup no. mobile not upto expectations lovely product nice phone dhasu quality when i put the hadephone but don\\'t show the sine of hadephone.....but i hear clearly on hadephone.... please tell me the process .. good good performance nice product.... it\\'s very very bad please don\\'t buy it this specifications of this phone look extremely good on paper and the phone itself is not bad looking. but the battery of this phone drains too fast and it may also overheat at times. if lenovo is able to fix these issues, this phone will be a great product. worst don\\'t by, i have problems, no support given by amazon please send my cashmemo copy to my gmail ac.of lenovo ki note mobile the mobile not support jio sim net work.how clear the issue.and some time camera couldn\\'t open nice phone.. when compared to nokia 6 i would prefer lenovo..u can\\'t get better for this price 13 days in to purchase the phone... the screen has started to flicker. best product as advertised awesome product each and everything is perfect except the battery life. it is 4000 mah but still drains very fast. i have use this mobile 4 months..not bad and no hanging troubles...but it\\'s get heating while using high processor game and by using multiple applications...not bad...well and good this phone is easily bend in your pocket during the normal use for which no warranty can be claimed by you from lenovo. battery is too bad, it has not capacity of a battery of 4000mah...disgusting... camera is good . i liked it very much totally awesome performance of the product was not as expected,it is better to avoid this product why google app is not responding. i see that message again and again.i got that phone today.and still i am facing this issue battery backup is normal. dont except better than others.also other features does not feel any extraordinary, just normal like other brands in same range nice phone. superb performance and look. no laggings, no heating issue. i gave 4 star bcoz the turbo charging is not good. its takes almost 2 hrs to fully charge the battery as a normal charger. overall good mobile@this price. worst phone, taking too much time to charge. performance is very poor excellent mobile and worth for money... processing speed good good when u look at specification but system ui is worst ever i seen, very normal ui, good hardware but camera is not good at 14k so choice is yours bad performance. no turbo charging. no speaker, no voice while calling after 15 days of purchase. overheating camera quality is very good sound quality is excellent and performance is good best stock android phone best selfie good battery life. great phone ...great battery .....but camera is not upto the mark........ otherwise the performance of this phone is very good.... charging problem amaging phone there is no head set in the box...disappointing so much...and i can\\'t contact to anyone for this very good phone and good battery backup also........ excellent hello guys.. worst product i say.. i bought it looking at its high end specs.. it doesn\\'t even support a cast screen option which is common feature in cheapest android devices.. also being so good processor it\\'s slow .. nice features and selfie camera getting hot while using internet for longtime poor battery backup and quikly warm almost 1year used now in 3months data cable is not worked and in 11months charger adaptor failed.is takes more time for battery getting full charge, quickly drained, heating issue not worth for the money.better buy honour or redmi mobile the product what u get for 14k is actually worth of it...1)it holds proper multi tasking2) front camera is excellent3) primary camera is well good enough for decent shots during night4) speaker are good5)fast charging6)curved glass with gorilla glass 37) battery drains comparatively soon..if ur going for performance and camera i suggest this overall goos.few things, i miss.casting to tv not working. i don\\'t know why. lenovo k8 doesn\\'t support smart tv or any where u need to do casting.. awesome performer smartphone till date i bought it in august. and within 2 months, i had to rush to the service center to get the battery checked. thank god, it was still in warranty period. after an update, battery started to drain profusely. suddenly, it was taking 4-10 hours to get fully charged. it wasn\\'t so before. the service center people say they\\'ll call you once they fix your phone, trust me, they don\\'t. the phone was okay for a while. the charger had a problem.then again, while charging the phone, i was using it. maybe for once. and bam! the charger got damaged. i had used htc before and used it while charging. nothing ever happened. -_-again i rushed. they charged some amount to get the charger cord fixed. now it\\'s working fine.problems:1. it heats a lot. can\\'t use it without cover. your hands will feel really warm if you don\\'t.2. can\\'t send messages from jio. imagine!3. it\\'s volte. but on the status bar, it says lte. stupid.4. very heavy. heavier when you use tempered glass to protect the screen. and you won\\'t get right kind of glass for the curved edges. hence, though the screen looks really premium, you have to use a flat tempered glass with no curved edges. it ruins the actual look.5. be prepared to be amazed if you didn\\'t know stock android phones don\\'t have gallery (other than google photos), no option for including ringtones, no theme, hardly any variety in the wallpapers and no customization. good phone at this price segment, though it lags for heavy gaming sessions, but apart from gaming and all regarding only about the performance this was good at this price, got it for 12k, camera also seems pretty decent camera quality nt so good. overall is good. good front camera not satisfaied this mobile phone is having problem found. handset is not switch on.. please rectify my problem and change the handset this model having so many problem.battery becomes too hot within using five minute. sometimes very very slow charging and takes 6 to 7hrs for full charging. it takes long time while restart phone. battery drains fast act like 3000 mh while my previous lenovo a6000 having better battery backup than this phone. it takes long time while connect with data network.night camera is also not good.only good thing in this phone having very good processor and very smooth touch screen and good speaker. leaving this other all things are bad in this phone. battery backup is less than a day ! and dual camera has some bugs ! good condition but.we reset the phone the turbo charger is cancelled mobile looks very sexy and its features are very nice. camera is great but most importantly, a good mobile phone at a lower price awesome phone and awesome features at this price point. pr 4k recording honi chahiye isme not worth the money.. the dual camera is useless.. the touch is not very responsive.. tends to hang at times.. do not buy this product !!! mobiles heat hojata heee in charging time awesome phone.... best one in this range... nice product overpriced great product in this price range. one should definitely go for it. cons mentioned by people are just minor and really nothing to bother. very bad don\\'t buy this product i bought lenovo k8 note on 18 august... but lenovo k8 note not good smartphone camera is too bad and heating problem in lenovo k8

lot and want to return good.i am changing after using seven months. mobile heats up . now battery charging has become very very slow and mobile heats up like a \" heater\". can\\'t even touch. final verdict \"useless\".one star because that\\'s minimum . i am using this phone from 2 months there is only 2 issue i found in this phone 1) sometime it lag in game like mff .2) battery back up is bad processor use too much energy .otherwise best selling phone at this range. except heating issue . others aspects are fine. while charging heat is generating very heavily ok, but not so good, lack some general features like call recording, internet speed etc not satisfied , don\\'t buy it. very goood productbattery bacup excellentsound quality is medium not that much best nice mobile phone not a good phone.....ui is badbluetooth do not function property no gallery icon. overall it is ok. phone is good but battery is not up to the mark as per specification i\\'m satisfied from this mobile nice features recieved the handset, found the audio jack not working properly. got it replaced, same problem was there. finally returned it and going to buy some moto product. hate it!!!product does not stand upto its expectations at all. what good are amazing specifications when the product hardware has such major faults. three star because this phone has a major problem which is its bluetooth. when connected to any bluetooth device be it headset or speaker the sound is very distorting and then disconnects. this has been raised by almost everybody in lenovo forum but no solution as of now. if you would be playing music on bluetooth or phone on bluetooth don\\'t buy this phone. camera good, battery goodonly problem is heating while playing games. not look like a premium phone when the system updat then phone will be haging..... and android version will no be suppoted......but battery pacup charging....is good thankxx again amazon for 1day delivery.lenovo k8 its fabulous phone. look wise ,bulit up quality n spcl thankxx for battery. guys, i am a normal user who need mobile for moderate use for multimedia ,i want to tell beware of redmi note 4 people here they are jealous here and you can\\'t have everything in this price.phone is awesome in sound,display, camera,speed ,lookonly con i face till now battery is not 4000 mah work like.but surely buy at a good price (venom black best in color.go for it .that was my first review after 3-4 days use.last review is that thank god, i have returned this mobile within time limit and got refunded 13,999.(can see within month price drop 2,000-3,000)even though i am a lenovo loyal customer as i loved k4 note and lost it in my office cab and now bought k8 plus also from lenovo way better.i request lenovo team to work on lenovo k8 and make it same like lenovo k8 plus.aman a perfect mid range mobile with awesome features in affordable cost..... all can buy it without any option best phone, but camera quality is ok not good enough... not good pls call me poor battery backup. here is my experience of using lenevo k8 since 2 days. got the mobile on first sale. with lot of expectations went for the phone.1)one of the worst phone i have ever used, very poor network signal. i was getting full signal on airtel but on k8 i am hardly getting 2 bars. signal is very very weak when compared to other mobiles.2)in the name of mediatek helio x23 processor they have used old mediatek helio x20 processor!!!3)heating issue, the phone heats even after 5 mins of playing a game or using camera. it\\'s back panel always feels warm and after few minutes of usage i cant even make call because it gets too hot for my ear to bear. we can\\'t perform the most basic function of calling ( without feeling the heat), browsing etc. the device always feels warm in your hand and a simple 10 mins of browsing and then you cant hold it against your ear to make a call,yes, it gets this hot.4)battery drains very fast, even when the phone is idle.5)the web support of lenovo is also of no use. i made the mistake of buying this phone, all of you out there please dont make my mistake6)notification led issues. i installed speed test and the network speed is terriblly slow!!!.7)incorrect specification \"dual nano sim with dual-standby (4g+4g)\". in reality this phone support 4g+3g only like other phones.8)signal strength is a huge pain. sometimes calls drop unexpectedly. amazon is not exchanging the product... poor network strength.i am going to make all my friends aware of the new amazon\\'s return policy. less in features not worth of money and expectations9)call recorder not working nice and very good model 1 star i am giving one star as 1/2 star is not available.bad phone with above average camera.frequent restarts. heating, battery drainage.not user friendly. k4 note is much better. already asked for return and refund.don\\'t buy k8 note very good it\\'s a super excellent product which i received from amazon thank u and the package was packed very well nice product.... my mobile nt getting charge nw.. wt ll do fr dat.. wr i ll go fr service.. second sim not working and mirror cast also not working worts phone from lenovo company nice mobile very poor quality getting hot from backcharger is not so fast take around 2 hour to full charge greate features at reasonable prize good mobile best one this phone is not good bcz heating problem is more. its not good... how is solve? i want to reutrn my phone no doubt, it\\'s a great phone & fast charging really works. lenovo k8 note for great front camera, good rear camera(bokeh effect is good only in well lit conditions), very good performance, better battery.... camera is great both front and rear similar to v5plus and oppo selfie. but only android version is there. no user interface. so no customization option. i say no. you can\\'t even change ringtone nd no applocker inbuilt. pathetic mobile. no sound getting hang after updating to oreo 8 when it was new it worked well but now after 2 months it horrible camera doesn\\'t open many apps crashdepth mode is not working properlyi have visited the service centre got temporary solution but then again same issue trying to call also phone is getting hanged. just 1 month old mobile. don\\'t go with lenovo k8 note. worst product!! amazon doesn\\'t even refund easily even though mobile is not working properly. worst experience ever with manufacturer as well as seller. the features are excellent but the usability isn\\'t there. despite a 10-core processor, 4 gb of ram, it hangs out quite frequently. i have an old huawei honor 6, 3 gb ram - 2015 model, which is better than the new device. also applications keeps on crashing quite frequently.camera is of not good use too. the pixel clarity is inefficient as it gets blur upon zooming (after clicking of photographs). also the time taken for saving the picture is +3 seconds after the click, which is quite high as i have never used such a slow camera in any phone.battery life is good. with constant data, frequent calling and mail checks, it runs for 8-10 hrs. also turbo charger is a great advantage.speakers are another strong point in the phone. the sounds are great, means comparable or better than my vaio laptop.the phone boosts of gorilla glass, but got scratch within a week of use while keeping it in pocket only.lenovo doesn\\'t have any gallery or music player apps, so had to download it from google play, which again either comes with advertisements or i need to purchase those. hence, i am stuck with the advertised versions of basic apps. also, had purchased new system updates, still had to update 2 gb of updates in total 3 times. still oreo update would be available only in june/july.the worst part is i had gifted it to my wife, and now what i got in return is the complaints part, that too all the time. means despite spending 10k approx., this device does not fulfil its advertised words. full had vedio not playing properly and also sounf break when connected to bluetooth.not prepared to purchase. worst phone ever purchased best mobile with excellent features and performance........turbo charging is one of the best features. what the hell is this i buy a lenova k8 note before 2mnth now this condition is very worst charge dry very fast and charging is very slow and heat over produced very very worst mobile very cool phone. easy to handle with almost complete features and specification. awesome i don\\'t find this phone worth.the phone does not work as lenovo claimed. they used dual in depth camera, turbo charger as a gimmick. should go for honor 6x for best alternative for this phone.ram management: processor and ram management is very good. the phone does not lag.camera: an awful camera. don\\'t know why its camera app decreases the quality of the image.the camera will really let you down.charging: it takes around 2 hours and 30 mins to charge completely from 15% which is a lot if the company claims for turbo charger.phone size & weight: there is some extra space at top and bottom which ruins phone handling experience.sock android: it is the only thing which is good.network issue: after switching my sims to this phone having the issue of the phone going not reachable. camera was not clear ghatiya productbattery bahut jaldi discharge ho rhi. phone heat karta h . lenovo ne ye kya product nikala haur amazon ke customer care executive wo aur mahanamazon se kuch kharidna hi nahi chaiye good not better please refrain from getting cheated by buying this phone. in the form of a stock android os, this phone has regressed a great deal from the previous k series phones. it does not have many important features like long screenshot etc and screen casting/mirroring is only possible if you buy chromecast device separately. the menus have changed from the previous version and are very user unfriendly. lenovo has taken a big step in alienating loyal customers by releasing this substandard phone to our markets and i caution all potential buyers to beware or end up feeling cheated like i am. k8 note satisfied when compared to same range mobiles in market ,slightly dissatisfied with cam quality rest all okpros- good battery capacity 4000mah,dual rear cameras,cons- non removable battery and weights about 180 gms little heavier. this phone is not truly dual sim 4g...and after updating it with android 8 it is totally wastage of money.heating problem ,slow charging, digital dolby sound is gone, mobile data tab is not working, battery backup is very poordr.v.singh good good this phone after getting the oreo update, is completely useless. it gets heated like a pan. you can literally cook dosa on the phone. lags like snail. turbo charge takes 7 hours to charge. when contacted the lenovo customer care about the issue, they are even clueless of the issue and asking me to wait for official update from lenovo, which they are also not sure when it will be released. if you buy the phone, dont damn update the phone with new software. use it with the stock os, android nougat 7.x version. battery life is crap rest is ok good product, could have been better. very good phone. in both of two camera front camera also awesome but rear camera can take photo with blur. sound quality also good with dolby atmos. music key works good. ovearl in this price range lenovo k8 note is a good performance phone. i love my phone good mobile bad product excellent..i have been using it for a long time now.. simply amazing.. battery is good..camera is fine too..overall pretty satisfying at this price screen mirroring option is not availablespeakers quality is not goodcamrea result bad camera is very very very poor don\\'t trust this it\\'s say 13mg pixel but pics are very poor in quality when u zoom into a pic the photo gets blurred it\\'s not up to the mark . my opinion out of 10 i give 2 rank ..for camera ..over all performance is gud but camera is very bad not even expected of such a low quality camera nice product nice mobile good touch nice look good performance the only one thing is battery drain is fast after 4010 mah... third class mobile..do no buy nice price worth mobile. ordered this phone for my wife after buying lenovo k6 power . design is good, but speaker sound surprisingly disappointing no where near to k6 power. came to know that turbo charger is not actually a fast charger (boom ! another surprise). verified camera and its nothing great compared to the way it is marketed. overall, feeling little disappointed considering i was expecting it better than k6 power.recommendation: nothing great, you can skip this one and wait for mi pro 2 or more reviews of moto g5 plus. nice phone ..i was using this phone more than three weeks...there is no issue still i found.. it is better then my expectations... i have brought this product in oct 2017 , but from six month i am facing the heat issue in charging and calling . from 2 month managing to work with this,but its become worst condition now. phone is in warrently, anyway to exchange this product value for money not good nice piece, though very crudely packed. timely delivered... faulty piece received. facing problem in touch screen. keypad operating automatically. apps, call history, dialling pads etc opening itself even not touching to the handset. bad experience of purchasing through amazon. worst phone ever. never going to buy lenovo products ever. brought this phone 2 months ago and i was quite happy with the performance initially. but yesterday it was just fell off the bed and the display cracked. it cost me 5.2k for new display. so overall i had paid 20k for this phone which i don\\'t think it worth.but i had no option. suggest everyone to stay away from lenovo products. lenovo may offers you high configuration phones @ reasonable rates but believe me guys their maintenance is way expensive. god bless lenovo consumers. good luck. awesome ....😘😘😘 good not a good phone it\\'s not even been 1month completed there a damage with the phone phone is getting over heated i want the phone back and neither i will pay the amount i took it for emi no dual camera just a showcase overall the phone is very good but heating issue stops you from playing heavy games or apps awesome the product is too good but the new update with oreo is very bad that\\'s why given 4 stars. overall phone is too good. i have used till 8 months and have been great till now. heat issue is there otherwise is its a everything fine . good one....working properly....no lags....no heating issues....jio sim working properly....i love this product...good configuration....camera is also superb.... good phone product is good battery problem i purchase this phone after many researches.camera is best at this price point.battery fhd display is good.almost everything is fine.but some cons. are there also.usable memory is less than half of 32gb.phone takes a lot of time to start.except this the phone is best and really a killer note. turbo charging taking 6hours to get full charge while device is on and taking 3hours to get full charge while device is switched off then after battery is draining like anything. im not a heavy user but this phone\\'s battery draining in just 20hours.i feel im wasted my money on this device.im not going to trust lenovo anymore n moreover ill spared my experience and discourage my folks towards lenovo products. nice phone k8 this is an really faster than snapdragon 625.every app opens fast.but the bokeh effect is very poor.very bad bokeh effect., selfie camera best great very nice mobile.. battery back up not good.... very poor handset please take it back phone overheats way too quick. 4000 mah battery barely stays 2-3 of gaming. i used redmi note 5 pro before this. same 4000 mah battery but note 5 can handle 5-6 hours of gaming easily. lastly turbo charging is joke; 10% - 100% in 2 hours 30 mins most of the time. sometimes getting heat , remaining everything good good product but bokeh effect not works well. otherwise acceptable. not so good very nice phone... good phone in affordable cost with all features.. camera was so clarity... battery stands long time... good product good phone on many aspects but lacks on some basic day to day requirements such as no inbuilt recording facility of voice calls, no video calling, doesn\\'t connect to jabra halosmart bluetooth. verry bad not able to open gallery after 5 days of usage turbocharging stopped working..now it takes about 6 to 7 hrs to get fully charged... camera is normal not so good.totally disappointed after 6 days of usage ... worth product this phone is quite fast. it\\'s finger sensor is useless when ever i try to use the finger sensor it says lens is dirty who will clean the sensor before every use or who will wash hands regularly before every use. one more point i could not find tempered glass screen protector for this phone i tried two screens but they broke after few days of use. i ordered one from amazon but that one did not fit properly on tis phone and broke within few days. nice worked only a day then it collapsed automatically disappointed me. some basic features are skipped. yellow light, call recorder not working, call log difficult to delete call from list, makes difficult to operate smoothly....made me sad poor while trying to register for warranty, it says no devicefound. how to register for warranty lenovo k8 note is good enough. but only one issue is battery heating problem due to this battery power gets drained fastly. very nice budget phone. awsome mobile\\'s camera is not up to mark and gets damaged easily in slight drizzle .so i rate 2 out of 5. nice good battery back up is very bad cheatedprocessor helio x20 used instead of helio x23 hanging problem frequently nice phone don\\'t buy this phone very worst very good android good not better phone battery not good paisa vashul phone karthik good phone in this price range, battery back up is ok, takes around 2 hours to charge good product worst camera quality. picture seems to be too artificial. also the problem of hanging and over heating. lenovo k3 note s better than k8 note... it has heating issues after updating new systems work poor battery problem really ???? is that 4000 mah battery??.....haha.....very funny......its not even works like an 1500 mah battery when it comes to battery backup..... very very very bad....i should have bought redmi note 5 pro.....i regret now...... phone\\'s performance is not up to the mark.....very slow sometimes.....4 gb ram and decacore processor is just good in papers...... heating is like volcano.......i fear when it might explode .... that\\'s the heating when playing games and heavy duty stuffs.....i am not at all satisfied...... lenovo should come with more future sofware updates for battery backup and performance......else it will be a disaster phone battery pickup and camera quality is very bad it\\'s a nice phone with good features. i have purchases lenovo k8 note in nov 2017... but i have been facing issue with charging since january 2018. i takes more than 6 hour to full charging. excellent mobile...a great feature made by lenovo.. ...camera clarity is too good best phone ever at this price overall good product. but i didn\\'t like camera quality and dual camera background blur is not good at all. the amount of blur it produces is not acceptable. battery backup is good. little heavy in weight. curve edges of screen interferes with touch capabilities of device when holding. worst phone i have seen not a good touch and the processor is not so fast. good, camera not as good as expected,performance good, battery life is really good very good performance display and touch nice very poor 5star1.looks good2.performance satisfactory.good for gaming3.battery backup good.stands for whole day on heavy use4.camera is very good. specially selifie camera.5.worth for money cell phone is quite good but i am very disappointed with lenovo. after launch of 1week i purchased this cell in 14000 & after 1 month the price of this cell is around 12000. i\\'ll never ever purchase any lenovo smart phone again + i\\'m not getting any software updates, camera not upto mark as i think . but fast charging and vr mode and rest is good at this price point its awesome phone... everything is good..but not have music player very nice smart phone.,...excellent fvvg very good prafomens phone is all time heated and charging is slow charging time phone is heating. and battery is discharged fast great i m using it for 1 month i don\\'t see any problems in it but when i switched airtel sim then automatically jio going offline why yeah lenovo k8 note is good phone under budget, tough competition to mi ,performance of the phone was very good,battery backup was decent,camera is also decent,sound system was very clear (dolby) 😍 .you will love music wen u hear with your headphones , wow camera and battery are very good.. heats up sometime..camera is unbeatabledolby sound is amazingcompactworth for the moneybest in it\\'s segment super heat too much battery back up is not up to the mark as per it\\'s capacity and look are not pretty good good product everything\\'s good except the camera. the rear camera do not work, it just keeps on focussing and then nothing happens. although while it was working before it didn\\'t clicked the pictures that we can say that they are from a dual rear camera phone. best phone in this budget!!! nice cheap and best very nice camera quality ans speed not that much good, as shown. good nice budget mobile...good service by amazon everything is fine on this phone heating like bulb good apps are not working properly. all apps are closing automatically fine nice phone the phone is good in looks and performance but lacks in

disappointing. great phone, ... nice nice working as expected... all features are looking fine...fast charging, good camera, dolby atmos one feature i liked very much product is worst get hang, when you switch on torch superrrr excellent mobile with multi features. amazon\\'s delivery is superb within 25 hrs i got it.camera is good . but poor low light performance.battery backup is good.nice display.i drop it once but it doesn\\'t even had a scratch.and so on...... such a shameless company. never buy its phone. cannot provide even a single update. they just sell their phone and then forget. i have lenovo vibe x3 a flagship of 2016. still stuck with android m system ui not responding is a persisting problem from within a week of purchase.also many a times touch doesn\\'t works properly.back transparent cover provided with the phone is not of good quality. phone is really good,but battery takes 2 hours for full charge. it\\'s good phone on this range but i have face 3 issue in my phone1. battery draining very fast2. charging time 3 to 4 hour with turbo charger3. some times phone display is white on low battery i am not recommand k8 note....my rating 2 out of 6 user

soon. worst camera 😒😏 this phone is very poor in network nice phone. it is not that heavy the way i thought initially. good quality display and surprisingly it came with basic back cover as well. delivered in time. overall good experience. very bad service from amazon if phone has got issues..battery will drain off in 10mins even it shows as 100%..it will get switched off in 10mins after you charge..worst reply from customer service if you call to resolve this..don\\'t buy this where headphone jack also won\\'t work..will have heating issues as well it\\'s performance is beyond my expectations good mobile. phone heating while charging too bad quality, network issue.......... i visited their service center in alpha market.... persons are very rude and non- professional.......i will never buy any product of lenovo again. best one heating problem, battery drains very fast battery backup not good. othervise performance, ram management, display very good. i need invoice for the same awesome phone.. semma fast i bought this phone jan2018.. phone is below average .... sound quality is poor dueto mono speaker.. picture quality is not as good as expected...some options in phone are missing... have no friendly features.. not prefer to buy have been using it for more than 4 months now. -this phone has network issues, wifi will not work continuously (always need to turn off and on the wifi in 2-3 hrs).-hotspot will not work most of the time and same is the case with bluetooth.already tried factory rest but no success.other than this it is good. worst phone ever. you want proof?just check the exchange value on amazon or flipkart for this phone. its 1600. never buy this.glass is broken after a month. good with headphones it will be nice. nice camera, display quality, sound and performance. external sd card- cherry on the cake. camera so bad.... waste of money nice ok its good one worst charging backup... very bad sestem my phone hangup now and hitting net usage after 25 minutes over heating system camera quality is average even with dual camera , battery back is less , even phone charge too late with 15 watt charger , phone heating problem as the name and features is mentioned..the quality is just below par... heating problems, battery back up, hanging problems..the worst experience when wanted to return ..then application has to be installed despite no return...was told to contact service center..fade up by the phone...kisi ko lena ho kindly contact me on my mail riajiaconsultants@gmail.com not so good and not so bad... it\\'s ok that\\'s all. value for money phone. excellent features, which most phones today are unable to match. this phone scores in terms of features - octacore proc, resolution, memory etc.flip side - battery is not great. very good camera .. hd display..finger print sensing.... but no in built gallery option for viewing photos. less option for widgets. calling console is not good compared to k3 note. sms app was better in k3 note. weight is more than k3 note. the back cover grip is not good for holding. overall it is a good phone. worth buying it. dual camera feature is just average, one speaker is not working, nothing special as it was promoted as killer... the display is very delicate my mobile has fallen for first time from 1 1/2 feet and the display has been broken worst not a good phone...just okay types... bluetooth is the worst feature...doesn\\'t connects to any device easily and if does stuttering starts and you can\\'t bear to listen....lenovo have fooled users by allowing mirroring only through chromecast...bad experience..it was my second lenovo and i am done with them... this phone is good and camera is osm and his working speed is very good and his bettery life is very very good.i suggested to everyone to purchase it.thank you amazon... high performance, good design, its worth the price, loved it, best phone at this price interface is also good. mobile ok. but bought this phone on light deal, just 2 days only worked properly after that faced problem of hearing sound automatically gets reduced and blocking calls without activating do not disturb option..... disappointed with lenovo. i asked to refund my money back with amazon. usb nahi mila mujhe this phone has 3.5mm jack specification but i am not able to insert my 3.5mm headphones. even with half inserted headphone it is not working. excellent mobile...value for money this is the best phone at this range of rate smooth operation but looking not so good not worth features mentionedhangs a lotheatingperformance not smooth camera and display quality down 👎 good very super mobile with this price i ever seen awsome phone in this price..great performance..super camera..love it.. worst phone ever, i want to return but amazon return option is not letting me complete return. the very basic feature like screen cast is not working. owsome phone..great camera. nice product in this price range, could have been slightly better. camera is better than rest of the lenovo devices. osm phone... with this price phone was not as attractive n featured as shown in its launch, not even received cash back till now. good poor phone is really good, just heavy 180gm but okayworking smooth. camera is 4 out of 5bettry 4 out of 5(not good as 4000mah ,)performance really good... but sometime heating issue charging problem ....it takes too much time for even few percent charging 😕 product is good , battery last for less than 1 day overall good but battery performance very poor good poduct not a battery back up very good usally more working more than 5 hrs only battery is too poor. its draining too bad when phone is idle. around 34% battery drained idle state. very bad product, no response on customer care side , mobile becoming lot of heat . after 10 hours charge also not becoming full charge. very slow.. 8 hours to get full charge.all other good heats abnormal, discharges fast, cast option is useless not connecting smart tv. bakwas phone. not good. plenty of options missing compared with ordinay phone. casting not available, some basics options like copying contacts is not available.totally i rate it below rating headphone jack is not working 😒😒😒😢😢😢😢 it\\'s not charged quicklyi don\\'t know what should i do good phone but the screen mirroring option is not working has some bug in software. does not even show the enable option in cast screen menu.looks like a problem in all hand sets. my old k4 note connects perfectly to my led. very good phone display heading problem 36 degree i bought this recently a week back and by mistake it has slipped from a very minimal height and the screen broke completely. the build quality is very poor. previously i was using moto for two years and i had slipped it down number of times and there was no issue at all.this time also i was about to buy motog5 but because of price came to lenovo and i regret now for not going to moto. good worst fone i ever bought ,it has some technical issues..it gets switched off every now and then and has some battery issues.i wont recommend anyone to buy it .its really worst cell phone doesn\\'t provide ear phones with this mobile,this mobile not support water resistance and repellent ,recently purchased mobile , display off, in service center they are saying this mobile not covers in warranty , i suggest u please don\\'t buy this mobile. product is having some heating issues. very good mobile in such a small budget but you should have given the headphone very bad phone. camera is below average, has heating issues even while calling.. impossible to hold, takes ages to charge..no point of dash charging, even gets heated while charging..also battery drains out very rapidly..4000mah battery is useless..my motog2 lasts longer even now..only good thing is that there is no lagging..altogether a big nooo... so far so good ... have been a lenovo user for a while . the phone does not disappoint... it is for sure value for money. just one issue , i am unable to record calls on the go . please do not buy it for the camera . otherwise it will take care of your basic daily requirements for a phone no timely updates good product killer note that is what this beast of a phone is! it\\'s really too good but one problem i facing that the phone doesn\\'t support jbl headphones.....and i don\\'t know which headphones will be support ,......... no complaints good excellent performance of device. don\\'t buy it . if you buy this product you will be in trouble with your body temperature even in winter also. battery weak product is good but battery back up is not proper it was mentioned as turbo charger. it is taking 5 hours to charge. disappointed . nice good budget phone compare to other in this segment ! great camera quality in this mobile dual speaker but only one speaker working ..i. was complain it but no action apply against this.. better purchase motorola mobile good mobile in this price segment..camera photoes quality is excellent(normal mode) but depth mode require some more accuracy to focus on object...overall a good smartphone.. just a word awesome..... not good very nice i am using this phone since last 2 weeks, battery life is not as good as they are marketing. if i use the games and internet, it lasts only for 8 - 10 hours. its not acceptable for new phone like lenovo. otherwise all other features, camera, overall performance is too good. look wise also its nice. best phone in this price range as compared to any other brand. good bougt this phone with great expectations but i had great disappointment there many key features missing....if you are used to mi i better suggest you go for note41.no call recording also third party app even pro version wont work .2.call history of only 3 calls per contact.3.torch/ flash is very bad.4.phone heat\\'s up during charging and also after!! it hangs a little bit and lags some fps in gaming like brothers in arms 3 etc. the deca core consumes more battery but still it manages to have power for a day the front camera is very good but the rear one is not good honor 6x has better rear camera than this, the stock android is nice and smooth but sometimes you have to restart your phone to work smoothly. best dont buy... heavy battery draining issue, even when it is in idle bluetooth connection issues. pairing issues with everything.lenovo customer care openly admitting there is issue in phone.now i am stuck with it; can return also. this kind of software issues should be deemed as a defective product by amazon. slightly over heating issues and slight hanging issues paisa vasool phone average product. not so good as other lenovo mobiles.poor battery backup of 14-15 hrs, mobile heats up while running applications.product not updated with current patches, appx 700mb update done after receiving the product.no turbo charging, mentioned on pack turbo charger.either it\\'s duplicate product or inferior quality by lenovo.wastage of money. good great phone bad nice features as i expected mobile ok. 3.5 mm earphone jack is not proper. none of the earphones is fitting properly. customer care people has asked to get it checked with service centre. i had checked on forum and many people have been facing similar problem.battery drains fast even after a normal use. awesome phone nice mobile awesome battery life,u can go for it. good phone this phone will be good, sensor touch also ok.but camera is not good.. this the worst mobile i ever seen in my life , i bought one year back and phone is dead within one year . my view don\\'t ever try to buy lenovo mobiles it\\'s awesome back of the phone has dent whithin 1 month. not good as it describes bluetooth not getting connected it not so use full piece is defective and can\\'t on why i gave only one star after one day of use just because :1. incoming calls are suspended few minutes after the screen locks . if someone calls it says out of reach , or i would have rate it 3 and half stars2. battery backup is not what i expected,not worthy for a 4000 mah3. camera quality is also below average.4. performance is very nice and smooth.5. sound quality is very nice and loud in speaker but lil less sound with super quality in earphones .6. looks is awesome . this is a wonderful product it is good budget phone and also working goodcamera of phone is awesome this phone, is not able to connect bluetooth properly it takes 4 to 5 times but audio breaks for some time and some time it connects well. next thing is audio port for headphones, is a complete failure, it always moves and disconnects. actually, i thought of going to take my phone to lenovo service center. where as the previous phone which i used was perfect over these, aspects. dual camera is of no effect. dolby atmos is incredible, for this reason only i bought this phone, gorilla glass is no.1, touch, and finger print sensor is awesome. 4gb ram rocks, in speed. battery drains fast and slow charging it\\'s hanging too much not happy with the product . i am feeling faked after buying this .hope i could exchange it . this is not matched with the lenovo k8 note phone... not covered whole part.... also camera and sensor not properly adjust with this glass ok mobile is great. using it for 5 month. only problem is battery does not last longer even after the oreo update. superb phone ..no issue at all 24 hrs since i have used it no heating issues and good battery just one charge has lasted over 27 hrs . superfast no lag good experience with lenovo k8 note plus duel camera with high definition..... setting functions kam he, har oppction ka ke lete aap download karna padta he,eg.riingtone set ker ne leye , ase bhoir se oppction nahi he suppppeeeerrr don\\'t waste your 14k. very good on time awesomejust little heating issueotherwise superb mobile.don\\'t believe on rumors device is working with jio 4g. having volte but showing lte only. nice mobile , working very fast but heating issue, and i want to some feachers updates,like camera quality, videos quality ,some etc not certification there is a volte mobile.. good product, good selfy perfect looks good battery backup excellentbecoming heat very fast other wise everything nice please don\\'t buy... regretting after usage of 7 days.. return policy is also bad heats up a lot.screen is not good.camera is really a waste.if u play games don\\'t buy it.network connection problems with 4gmobile will heat up for the following operations1. playing a game for > 10mins2. charging3. talking on phone for more the 15 minstoo much heat..don\\'t buy this phone. just received the phone which i bought using card payment. and the phone is dead on arrival. it\\'s not even switching on. shame to lenovo and amazon nice handset i have been using this phone for a week now and it is perfectly fine. the performance for normal apps is best. i am not a gaming guy but the other business apps work best. no lag no heating issue. charges fast. camera is ok. sounds are awesome with normal earphones also. good bt not as expected it\\'s gud speed processing i have been using this product since 20th august and its been good but not in par with the contenders like redmi note 4 or the recently launched moto g5s plus. but to be frank its a good phone in its way, the design is a choice of preference i like it but you may not so its matter of preference and don\\'t forget to get a case its a slippery device. it\\'s a bit on heavy side but its not a big deal. the display is good but i wish it could be more brighter. the built-in speaker is good,its loud and crisp(for the price), the dolby atmos is a gimmick i don\\'t see much improvement when turned on or off but still its there if you want. but the built-in dac for the headphones is on a bit of lower side i don\\'t see it as a good one, audiophiles stay away from this. coming to the camera(s) they are ok but there is a need of improvement. the primary camera(13mp) is good for outdoor shots but in indoors its worse you need to go for other option if indoor is your preference, flash can light up but you trade in for noise and you have a depth effect which uses the second sensor(5mp) at he back to add a bokeh effect and its in need for a huge improvement the edges of the subject is soft and to find the focus you will have a hard time. the video quality is good if you have enough light but there is no image stabilization so you need to have steady hands and it tops out only at 1080p at 30fps while the processor can handle 4k. the front facing camera(13mp) is good though if you are in need it has a dedicated selfie flash and it works. the battery backup is also good i get nearly 4-5 hrs of screen on time but it depends because the mtk processor in this is not that efficient but you get rapid charging which charges the phone from 0-100% in about one and half hour to two hours. the software is similar to what we get in moto devices(since moto makes these devices) so you can expect pure build of android with 7.1.1 nougat. but i haven\\'t seen any security updates and its on july month\\'s patch. the performance is good for the price you are paying, i think memory management is a bit on aggressive side but its ok you can\\'t expect much from a mid ranger. i will update the review once it is update to android o. good till now. bad than 10.or g there is no screen shot option.and your service center service is poor in indore there is no gallery facebook and some of apps are not open... not even 1 year completed, now showing heating as well as battery issue. it gets drained out early and after that not charging fast best phone.camera quality is very good.very fast speed item was defective,dont know it will replace back. also the price cut down by rs.2000, feeling cheated by amazon . an ok product for the price over all gud ... but battery work is not gudslowly charge and fast empty im happy good phone with in the budget.. works smoothly and camera is great. mediatek helio x23 works fine let\\'s see for futurecons - no nfc, no ir blaster it can beat any phone both within same range, cost and beyond it\\'s cost. a phone costs about 20k also can\\'t compete with this phone. no heating issue, extreme speed of processing, a sexy look from front side oval type glass, hillarious sound with it\\'s dolby atmos speaker, full water & scratch proof, the best part is the back duak camera with which you can record video in slow motion mode & can take picture in depth mode and then can edit those pictures in depth mode also. believe me.....it\\'s simply the best among all smart phone in it\\'s rang & beyond it\\'s range also. i bought lenovo k8 note one month back and lenovo make me to think why i choose lenovo it is just one month cell with lot of problem and no proper service or feedback from customer care main problem is battery issue in just 3 hours my battery goes from 100% to 60% and i try to reach customer care but no use no proper service very worst better before buying pls think twice... gd product in low price nice phone.. front and back

victim of lenovo n amazon. my frnd suggested not to go with lenovo, inspite that i ordered n made biggest mistake. it heats up like hell n took 1hour to charge by 12-15%. i contacted amazon n they puzzled me to technical department then smartcheck app, technician visit. n now after 5days they are saying they will replace not refund. i am regular amazon customer but it is my first bitter experience which is now becoming worse. good camera at this price nice handseti love this product bad battery backupdue to mediatek processor battery: although it has turbocharger it drains too quick and takes more than 2 hours to charge it. too bad.heating: phone gets heated up very easily.processing: it can\\'t handle simple games and stutters while gaming.buy only if you are looking for an expensive iron box. performance good. camera ok. battery packup bad. worst product please don\\'t buy and frequently switch off i am using this device from 2 days. and still i can\\'t found any type of defect from lenovo k8 note. this note is really killer then other notes at this price. both cameras are really killer. and the display is awsome. its decacore processer is working very nice then snapdragon. the device is slim & grippy. battry life is good. all over i can say that according to lenovo this device is really killer #killer note ever. defective piece value for money 1. nice camera, portrait mode work well,selfie camera good.2. touch screen and user experience is nice.3. performance is good. hanging is not issue.4. battery life is wonderful. last for a full day for heavy

properly. and i returned the mobile.10 completed no replacement mobile i did not get..still waiting..dont buy this product. sim ejector pin not available in box found all the features good however not happy with the battery performance. i am in a business where i have to switch on my data 24*7 this phone last not more than 10hrs a day. else everything is awesome good but not the best heating issue take place and battery drained to much faster after 20 percent just irresistible so cool handset over all v.good all around. nice initially looks good. after using two three months, stars to hang abruptly. though it is 4gb ram speed is very bad. battery is about 4000mah. still drains very fast. not worth to buy this product. really good phone i thought that camera has best feature with dual camera.. but when you capture with dual camera its not natural,,,seems to be edited waste of money. if lenovo don\\'t know what is turbo charging i\\'ll explain. it taking 3 hours to charge. is that turbo charging? and that will drain in hours of matter. is that called battery back up. please stop making people fools with false promises. u can survive now by fake promise and advertising, but once u lost trust you cannot be in market race. super there are many issues in this device1. poor sound quality2. network issue (if you switch from wifi to mobile data, internet will not work you have to restart your device)3. fluctuating network signal4. earpiece volume is very very low (almost half of k4 note). music quality is very bad5. you will get a lot of noises while listening music.5. speaker

is fast draining battery. nice phone. camera is good, specially like the depth enabled feature.it has with long battery life and lot of storage space. doesn\\'t heat up when browsing. slightly heavier

it is bad product so many times heating... battery quick dry.... don\\'t purchase.... it\\'s a good smartphone as compare to other phone within this price range, but some features are missing in this

(surprising) i bought with lot of expectation but sad i had bad experience. also th gorilla glass which is bosted so much is not up to the mark.\\'i asked amazon for return due t above defects, return was scheduled , as i had no option i had to use this mobile in the mean time. i was in mall and mobile was in my hand , it just slipped from my hand as its slippery n heavy mobile n again to my surprise it has spider crack . screen& touch survived but there was crack on the screen (it still working tho)this time it took time for amazon to respond in collecting the defective mobile . and 09 sep i raced the issue return pick up has been scheduled but its not been picked up till date. this has some as a customer made me worried of buying products online . hope amazon is taking a note of all this and will resolve my problem asap. superb semmaya iruku good product & battery its a great mobile....must buy....great service by amazon camera good value for money....processor finebattery is ok oklittle heating but it\\'s fine cool mobile... v good just ok camera performance is very bad. and mobile is getting over heat badly.. waste of money and time. awesome product good mobile and fast to operate thisbut soft copy of bill is not come to me please send to me a soft copy of bill i want bill please replace phone 2 times but still same network issue... too much disappointed..worst phone i ever use not fully satisfied with the product due to network connection issue - bluetooth and wifi and heating issue. seems faulty product - lenovo k8 note.bluetooth paring successfully done with wireless speaker and car\\'s music system however the music/voice quality is not good. music playback is neither continuous nor smooth via bluetooth, too much interval while calling though bluetooth. screen mirroring is not possible with tv as mobile devise is unable to find the available cast screen devises(tv).even after updating ota update the problem still unresolved.lenovo should rectify the issues.turbo charger is very sluggish and took 2 hours to full charge the devise (if not used, while using it took 5-6 hours to charged fully).however the mobile looks good and rest of the feature works fine like display, calling quality, camera, touch, etc.camera is good despite of negative review by leading technical reviewer \"phone me koi khas dam to he nai\", \"lenovo mamu bana raha he\" etc. camera works fine as single camera, as well as in depth enable mode. camera performance is good and justify the mobile price range. (don\\'t misguide by opinions of tech reviewer).i used lenovo k4 note for 18 months, and satisfied with the phone, so purchase 2 k5 note for my dad and sister and both devises works fine without any issues. i purchase k8 note but not satisfied with the product. phone getting over heat and battery getting dry soon.most of the times unable to pick call,and sometimes touch also not responding.net

it..ear piece volume for calling is less specialy if outdoor its difficult to hear..phone is ok.. good one i didn\\'t like this mobile. weak grabbing of network signals. 4000mah is only for our eye feast. only good thing is separate sd card slot which is not in many other phones. call quality also not good. camera not good. gaming is better. screen cast also not working. i will never buy lenovo product again in my life time killer looks fully features loadedvalue for moneylight weight slim zero performance . sim range fluctuate. not working properly.after one day i use my old mobile instead of k8 lenovo excellent phone at mid-range price battery is not good good issue in product.. this handset is getting heated within 15mins of continuous use. camera quality is worst.phone is getting switch off after full charge.sound is also not good. worst the product when taken was fine but now after using for 9months there is bright fire like light emerging on the side of the mobile. it\\'s very disturbing. if anyone can help with this thing please write back to this review. nice to use.... it\\'s a good device like as sound,picture quality, camera and value for money. heating problembattery not good my phone getting heat easily when i charging and using internet less than half an hour,,,, overall performance of this device is good and is a value for money purchase.the main problem is with net connectivity, when you r receiving call on secondary sim primary sim losses net connectivity....charging is average, with dual sim charge remains hardly for a day use...and charging is a 4 hr job....which is a bit high.... it is good as it says. surprisingly battery doesnt seems to stay longer as a 4000mah. i want to invoice copy please do not buy this phone this phone is not at all good please buy mi a1 from flipkart leneovo is not at all good unhappy with motorola and lenovo please buy mi this has cheap chipset mediatek wich comes under 3k phone so i suggest you to buy mi because they lower the price at very high level i am using mi a1 it has snapdragon 625 wich is very good please don\\'t buy this phone unhappy lenovo good product lenovo k8 note 4gb ram is not working properly, data downloading and uploading is very slow comparing to moto c plus 2gb ram peace is very good. at the time calling speakers are not good working, i am unsatisfied with this device lenovo k8 note 4gb ram battery back up is not so good.hearing issue when you play game.other camera is good...but when you use dept mode...object edges blur.processor are superb. display are decent good performance. good product excellent value for quality. item received damaged i bought the phone a month ago and so far the phone is excellent.. i will post about more comments later. very nice good phone lenovo is not fixing 4g network issue and battery.. if both issues they fix .. this is osm phone.camera clarity is par and fantastic slow motion video. as name of phone killer, really it shoots on it. worst qualify of camera(rear and front both) in the current advance age of technology. all images quality like vga cameras. no use of due cameras with dslr and this phone didn\\'t meet my expectations as i saw in advertisement (disappointed me). i have been using yureka phone that has premium quality of camera. i am feeling bad for my decision and wasted my money, i will buy some other phone. i suggest, really don\\'t go for it.selfie camera is also worst. cameras does not have real-time bokeh, pro-mode & depth editor etc as suggest in the advertisement. it is completely different with all commitment.this phone does not support dual standby (4g+4g)it takes complete 2.5 hour to full charge.battery back up is not so good.sound is also not good. so far so good... good product.found heating problem. apart from that performance is good.no call record option.have to install third party app for call record.good.but not excellent. bad phone i bought this for my dad, and i choose this over redmi note 4!battery charging sucks!dual camera, lolheating issue - while charging as well as normal usage like browsingbattery life ain\\'t that great, just one day in normal usage.i think they designed this phone overnight, assembled it and put it on sale!that carelessness is clearly visible when you hold this phone in your hands.i\\'m writing this review to save your pocket because the sale is on this. please buy other phone in this price range and don\\'t waste your hard earned money on this peice of garbage!!my current phone - oneplus 3, solid performance even after an yeari bought redmi 4 for my mom and that\\'s a great phone too.you\\'re welcome :) no ear phone, but it taking more time to charge. good but heats up a lot while continuous 1 hourand little bit hang while heating time..... dslr effect is just for name..... vry poor camera not a good item i have just purchased lwnovo k8 note but there no netwrk coverage inside the home.while in other mobile networks are ok at the same place. i want new and proper printed bill... hit the phone very fast best in class and a true beast ....5 stars definitely !honest k8 user... :) excellent phone with great specs. worth a buy. occasional heating issue every other feature serves more than what expected, except for the fact it has a little heating problem. very good phone is ok but amazon packing is very poor,this mobile 2nd sim not working for 4g only 3g, amazon is wrong specifications for this mobile best heating issue r there....and no backlit,... battery drains fast...processar is fast no lags... display is very sharp....click good photos...selfie camera is also too good... overall a great budget smartphone better to buy kenobi z2 plus with snapdragon 820 processor which makes it future proofrather than buying this mtk processor phone pros:good battery backupfront camera is awesomeenough space on devicetouch is awesomefingerprint unlock works like a charmfree mobile back coverseparate slot for sim and sd cardandroid o will be available sooncons:network problem with jio4gphone lags sometimesfacebook crashesdolby atmos is of no usedual camera is a hoax.. no use. mobile configuration, camera is good. but unable to charge it faster. its taking 5-10 min for 1% charging. mobile is good but headphone missing no head phone and screen guard.no flip cover.mobile is good worst phone, i bought this phone last week, it fell down from 1 feet, corilla glass broken, cheap quality, my previous phones fell many time from my hand never broken.many complaints there regarding this model touch screen broken issue. i went to near by lenovo service centre there already six k8 note phones with broken display.it is failure model. awesome phone.receieved 2 days back. earlier i was sceptical after reading reviews but i m satisfied after receiving it. both cameras are working fine, it\\'s not very heavy and bulky. looks sleek and very good features. it\\'s a good phone with good specifications after using the phone the design and display is great but many bugs are there in this new product and i found thisfirstly the power button is not working properly .secondly the dolby atmos is not working properly .third the battery drains out quickly...i found many more also the processor heats extensively. i would request my buyers ,look properly before any purchase of k8 note..its worthless. today is the sale ..don\\'t go for this phone better than others...satishfied. but no ear phone wd this set after a update or watevr nw my phone battery is working properly,,,turbo charge works & decent battery life,,, con :cameraheatingbattery signal complaint not received call after screen off good mobile as of 29/08/17 i paid 13999/ that too on line with hell lot of buying pressure, now it is offered with discount of 1000/ and 2000/ on 3gb and 4 gb respectively,its not even that worth you opt for xiomi or redmi but not this phone. yaar wapas le ja lo isey 😠 defective product. returned it and got a replacement. it was still defective.couldn\\'t connect to wi-fi :-( this is the worst ever product by lenovo. display doesn\\'t work properly. when i try to open any menu or folder or app phone stops working get switch off automatically. heating is another serious problem. vibration mode did not works from first month... charger does not works after 6 months not bad don\\'t buy... nothing is new... i use this product last one month and i feel good about lenovo k8 note, this is very nice smartphone and good performance (no heating, no hanging, great camera quality) i really happy after buying this smartphone. to vorest product don\\'t purchase this mobile expected the beast performance, however very disappointed with its performance. cheaters, i am not sure why is amazon promoting lenovo so much and making it so tempting for customer to have it. upgraded from k3 note. definitely speed improvements seen. little better camera too. but, not really a feature-rich device. doesn\\'t even have some basic features that were there in k3 note . average power backup. best phone at best price......phone functioning is smooth just like \"makkhan\", at this price tag i think this phone prove to be value for money.battery life is good, goes almost a day for average calling & data usage. but for heavy caller & data usage it may work max 6-7 hrs a day. little bit heating issue faced while charging, but leaving this thing apart its a best mid-range value phone between 10-15k... could give it 5 stars but it\\'s battery backup is very bad....everything is good but the battery disappoints very badly improve flash quality best smartphone by lenovo. worst mobile.it claims to be a 4000 mah battery but charging doesn\\'t last even a half day.doesn\\'t get the signals of sim networks(checked by inserting sims in another mobile. sims got good signals in it)heats up quicklyfront camera is 13 mp but photo clarity is like 5mp after use of 5 months .i will say poor quality product please don\\'t buy very poor battery backup ... i think my money was wasted by buying this product.... i have bought it 5 days before..thank you amazon for quick delivery.. phone is working fine.. but battery backup is not much as expected rather then phone is good in this budget... nice terrible phone..battery draining problem.worst look- for gold color case front display is white.automatic closing of background apps.camera quality is pathetic, front flash never works.sd card not readable.unnecessarily heavy. best smartphone at the price of 14k.both cameras rear and front are excellent.battery backup is very good.fingerprint sensor is very good. only drawback is notification led not work for missed cals and emails... and everything thing is good.. charging drain quickly....and hearing problem occurs good phone nice phone very painfull product0 star not so killer device, heats up on playing even basic games like candy crush. too heavy for modern phones. and data connectivity issues this product has network issues want to replace the product not what displayed and expected sencer not use superb mobile... very bad camra quality and back key is left side so not easy to use average, doubt if this an advanced version. earlier versions had auto call recording and screenshot facility in built. this is missing in the advanced lenovo k8 note. 1)heat problem2)hang problem3)battery problem4)network problem nice phone in offer and before time deliver. minor heating issue, camera ok, battey is ok very good product 1. my phone got switched off from 15% battery within few seconds.. worst battery performance.2. dual camera is for name sake only. poor camera performance..3. network issues when 2 sims are used..definitely a no buy at this prize point.. best under this segment it\\'s awesome smooth fantastic phone with dual camera and high deca core smoothly workingotg supported ...curve edges,.. gorilla corning ...4 gb ram ...and many more features good i wonder how this product is released in to the market without proper testing.because this device isn\\'t stable.i ll make it simple, charging will be dried out by evening even for moderate usage. 4gb ram or processor, i am not sure about the culprit.when ever i open images, it hangs and shows error message. my lumia phone with 512 mb ram is better than this.camera is awesome.i feel that i wasted my money. nice one by lenovo.i don\\'t counter any issue .it really is a good phone with good features. i am very disappointed with this product my mobile charger is not working worst of brandambassador signal problem... signal problem... battery problem.... not even 1 year after purchase all these problems good working mobile is overheating cant kept in pocket been using it since 2days.what you get for 13k am gonna share,sincei got the 32gb/3gb variant which is enough for my usage.looks are good sleek and slim not wide like redmi note 3/4.venom black is good quite contrasting. can\\'t say about other variant.battery is moderate for 4000mah you have to charge twice if your heavy user. yes turbo charging does work.but standby could have been better. as you have got power you gotta compromise somewhere. if it could have paired with sd 625 battery would have been promising but can\\'t do anything now.hardware aspect now,10 core power yes you do feel if your sd 625 user,as i was i felt it faster.only issue i would like lenovo to improve it ram optimisation,i know it need software update or something for betterment in this aspect,i only hope lenovo delivers it fast enough because with usual 50 apps installed you will get 50-60% utelisation,in sd 625 it was somewhat lower to 45-50%. rest you won\\'t feel any lag or something,it just need an software update.now focus point of these smartphone,cameras. lets talk about the front 1st,its decent enough for selfie but not meant for poor lighting condition. in good light you will get good pics.now rear,13+5 normal camera works good. also during in depth which means both lenses will be active you get some shot like slr,good innovation for budget phone but same like ram it need software updates for optimum utelisation.i love stock android,and i loved this was of stock android,though i did miss the menu button no issue its just fine replacement.i would say,for the price segment the pros are too good to let you buy one. so go for it.only issues or cons are with software,lets hope lenevo releases new patches frequently taking in mind of the users and reveiwers.and yes corning + 2.5d glass works like charm. kuddos lenovo.thanks.p.s-hope lenovo checks the reviewers,to improve their product....update:after 20daysfacing a severe issue,while kept phone for idle about 1hr or more everything works fine just,text messages you send are not being delivered,again you have to power off and turn on for it to deliver. why the heck is that?also the last patch update was on july 5th 2017,please kindly deliver a update soon. today is 10sept 2017 more than 2months have passed. kindly fix.this made me think about my choice i made on lenovo. nice nice phone in its price range :) with all best feature one can dream of. not good extremely unsatisfied with lenovo k8 note 64gb battery consumption in 6 hrs and saying 4000mah!!!, turbo recharge takes more than one hour not minutes as said!!! rare camera is very bad, never could be 13 mpixel network is bad in the mobile, never due to the area or telecom company. heating issue as well. there could be extra issues in soon future. average phonebattery 4000 mah but not work for full day phone goodcarmera as per expectation not so goodoverall best with its pricedont expect much from camera waste of money don\\'t buy it is not good game work slowly heatting we not return item only repair not take lenovo k8 note it is wast of money. absolutely amazing got 3gb varient no issue in handling any kind of game in high graphics good battery best camera(as my opinion)no heating issue.....but....slightly disappionted by display the color production is not good enough and also the display has a little yellow tint which makes white slightly yellowish(not noticeable until other phones is brought near)...and i wish lenovo will fix the ram management issue with providing android oreo update....but phone is awesome in all othet factors... good over heating problem, half day battery backup, feeling bad and not recommended mobile after 5 months usage , it is good for all aspects.. waste performance of battery , net work connectivity and camera. battery performance is very worst connectivity suddenly failure ,i also compared with other devices.battery back while using net is very worst performance.waste of money. it\\'s osm, it\\'s amazing, it\\'s fantastic, it\\'s superb.... & what next i say about it. it is all & everything which i want. amazing speed, amazing camera, amazing dolby sound.amazing experience with this product.really i\\'m very satisfied with the product. supet googel play services not responding show phone is very good.. but it\\'s camera is low as compare to other phones in this range.. specially it\\'s depth mode does not works as expected.. can lenovo fix this? everything is fine but i needed invoice for the same item please email it on my resistered email. this product is very bad. please dont fall for high specs and compare it with redme note 4 or any other phones at this price range. it is having lot of heating issues even for normal usage. i have been using redme note 3 from more than a year but never faced hanging issues in chrome browser. with k8 note the browser hanged, battery drained very fast and some of the calls got dropped.by seeing at that high specification, i though this could be very good deal but this is very much disappointing. please go for the brand which is very much trusted and having a lot of positive reviews.i request amazon to kindly consider my request for return and refund the amount. flipkarts return policy is much better and easy to operate. phone is good but the phone is heat after playing the game as par samasung on next lenovo k8 plas very poorand rs willbe same very good condition good battery an budget phone very nice phone... satisfied. the bluetooth headset keeps stopping on my device. the earphone port is not drilled properly as i cannot insert my earphones nice phone good one i think it\\'s a good phone under this price. if anyone is going to buy it my suggestion is go for it. every phone will have

will tell people not to go with some idiotic negative reviews who are sold in the hands of xiomi. best phone under this price bad experience : there is no image software includes rather than photos app.and camera also.good : all other less features in operating system, less user friendly than xiaomi, or any ither phn,, heating issue,, slow operationsbttry gd, dsplay size weight, memory, cam good sound good phone is awesome for 3 weeks of usage but it takes 2-2:30 hrs for full charging and get heated while charging and our own ringtone setting is miss here otherwise better mobile nice mobile for this price range good mobile.but battery warest 😢😢😢😢 not good product it\\'s just heated up within half an hour of any game. nothing to say, nice phone i have purchased third lenovo handset, prior to this i\\'m currently using lenovo k4 note. k8 is at par with k4..3gb ram version stands at par with k4 note which was released 1 year ago..phone is gud at luks and performance. lenovo has a patent problem of heating with all its premium to low class devices & as expected it persisted with this handset as well. hanging problem phone is pretty good working pretty awesome but i find it that it gets over heated while charging.apart from that everything is good good sorry to say that there is no headfone in the packet best at this price.. value for money contacts are deleting automatically. awesome at its price n little bit laggy after updated.. best features, picture quality is awesome, overall, very good phone in affordable price. dolby atmos / sound output is pathetic. i used my sony headpones other lenovo k series it was awesome. but on this it is like using some cheap chinese phone. even my samsung on5 gives far greater output than this.i searched online, & found that people are already complaining to lenovo about this issue but no action has been taken yet.unfortunately i am not able to return this as there is no option available from amazon.dolby was the only usp in k8 which i was looking forward to & that came out to be the worst one.extremely disappointed ! nice phone by lenovobrilliant processing speedbattery in moderate good the worst camera experience in this price segment....but performance is the best.... outstanding processor and ram....but lenovo plzzz update your camera algorithm... not a good phone, restart automaticaly premium phone, camera quality is very good, stock android makes it even better, performance is decent but the only one missing thing is you don\\'t have one hand mode other than that it is worth of buying.please release the accessories for this phone good but not best..... update needs charging slot not as per brand name, in just one month facing big issue regarding phone charge best phone in this segment.front cam is ultimate.night selfie is awesome.latest andriod.microsoft application given as default.fully satisfied it is good. in terms of performance, i would re-command this phone. look & feel need to improve on this range. phone delivered was faulty not good nyc ph,,, super have been using the lenovo vibe k8 note for the last few days and was shocked by their warranty policy when i visited their service centre in jayanagar bangalore. the warranty covers only software issues only. the gorilla glass is of cheap and mediocre quality as mine cracked on falling to the ground. the cost of replacing the panel was rs 5500. the warranty did not cover the same. was terribly disappointed with lenovo. lenovo k8 note is pathatic . very slow. very fast battery heating. operating system is freezing and not alert. saved option get reset automatic. no sms alert, etc. very heavy and fat as well good the in the box mentioned \"handset, 2 piece 15w turbo charger and usb cable\" , unfortunately i received a single piece of 15 w turbo charger only mobile, charger and manual book of lenovo k8 have been received. ear phone not available with phone. i buyed this product. before 3 months its battery is not

warmer n warmerbut after back to back patch updatethis warming of phone has been reduced.the turbo charger:during the initial days the mobile used to get charged within 1hr 15minn now it\\'s taking nearly 2hrs to get full charge.the battery last max for 14-16hrs if you use the mobile with internet on. not upto to expectation. very delicate phone not built for regular use. headphone missing in the boxgood phone... good the cashback offered by hdfc credit card has still not transfered to the account i was using lenovo k4 earlier..never had connectivity issue.. now with my new handset.. both the sims gio and vodafone are giving me connectivity issues.. can someone help..my phone keeps on going on forwarding i like lenovo k8 note charging time automatically switch offthis is problem.not a

but tubro charger worst than normal charger. super ,i am loving it. phone is gud ,no one can find all this ram ,storage,and cemera in any other mobile ,mobile is little heavy but it can manageable .the biggest problem which not me but every one will face is a charging problem ,it\\'s come with turbo charger which is not so gud this is the second time my charger\\'s turbo is not working .company will take 4-5 days to change it and the most unusual company policy is that they use too refresh mobile every time when ever u go there .i am very upset with this . it doesn\\'t get charged fully even after keeping it on charge overnight.the phone get heated very quicklygets restarted automatically. if you are relying on alarm, it may not sound as your phone will be switched off. worth for money, but average camera not as expected. worst phone very super mobile and courier wonderful delivery nice phone. very bad phone working as a chinese mobile sometimes battery charging sometimes not heatup

திரண்பேசி_smart phone. ok..good grate very good working dual camera performance is not as specified by lenova featured packed phone for a low price. screen gives a rich feel. it is splash proof, many of the costlier phns too dont have this feature. decent camera but bad bokeh mode. the camera cant trace borders properly. battery backup not upto the mark. it has a 4000mah battery yet it gives a back up of 10-12 hrs on moderate usage. sometimes applications lag, they become unresponsive as well. thank you amazon for the refund on this. its a cheap chinese phone, dont buy it, battery drains,

chahte ho to 500 rupaye do aapka refund ka process bana deta hu. hai i bought a new levono k8 note. the levono system is upgraded the battery charging very slow .why ? what\\'s happening? what\\'s the solution battery backup is not goodoverall performance is good worth for your money overall phone does well. ram and rom are extraordinary. battery backup and rapid charging is very good. especially rear and front camera is superb..but when i connect it to any speakers via bluetooth, it\\'s very irritating. totally disappointed in this matter. i hope that manufacturer can fix this problem in the next system update. when i listen the music via bluetooth speakers it interrupts very much. but lenovo k6 power works very well when compared to k8 note. perfect phone here is a true review after 10 days of use,cast screen is not working,or some good fetures like many lights indicator,data speed indicator in notification is not available like older version of lenovo notes..some fetures is degrade instead of upgradefront flash light is good but no results of dual cameras..but in this price this phone is very good overheating- even during mild usage , it gets hot like hell. good phone. battery is only prob.. nice product. loved it.the only thing which bothers is no inbuilt call recorder. but we can definitely go for third party apps for that. the product recieved as it was described. nice phone in this price range..... overall product is good but in headset audio output is very low /poor even ordinary phone of 2-3 k range has this much output ,may be it is manufacturing defect as i used lenovo k4 & 5 and found audio quality very good of these edition and for same reason and experience i ordered k8 note asked amazon for a replacement let\\'s hope to get something positive in replaced handset . hope amazon will help me get a replaced one ..will update full review and rating only after receiving replacement .... very good phone i got the phone yesterday evening only and i am very disappointed with the product. lenovo is such a brand and coming up with this type of phone will degrade its reputation. i bought this phone because i previously used k3 note.following are its cons:-1) camera is very bad, i captured a couple of pics in night mode and day mode there are really very bad with regards to clarity.2) they say its turbo charging but the charging is no that speedy it gets fully charged at 6hrs 30 mints. please suggest me how can it be called turbo charger if its so slow.3) the look is not that nice and attractive.4) it gets heat very fast.5) the battery also drains very fast and with in no time it comes to 50%.6) sound quality they say its dolby but no where it is near to it.i would really avoid purchasing this phone instead go for oneplus 5 or samsung j7. or c7. mbl is good but it is routed device so some apps were not running on this mbl perfect phone in this range. amazon doing great job. don\\'t buy this product. i buy this before a week ago and it is not working correctly the mobile is not good. the battery lasts only for an hour if you have charged fully and charging time is taken more as compared to other mobiles. also the battery heating problem is there. amazon is very good service of delivery .nice set which is very smart.till i give 4 star .and i will check 5-6 days more it then i give final review. good phone ,value for money. really a good package.. very poor quality. all apps will be like not responding .waste of buying lenovo , i am writing this review after 3 months of usage nice product not up to satisfaction. battery backup 👎 , depth mode bakwasssss...artificial lagta hai. very bad.it is heating too much immediately when we use internet and declining battery fast or drains very poor experience ,turbo charging is not working,over heating, huge battery loss my review after 1 week use of this phone.heating problemcharging super fastback camera patriod mode not availablefront camera is goodbattery will last for 3 to 4 hours in continue gaminggetting hang when i use for 3-4 hours continouslyheating is main problem im facing right now..its get so much heat..we get only 22gb free internal storage out 32 gb and that is not good for me phone is slim and it looks good and performance is also great good for gaming people and battery life is also amazing..picture quality is also good just waiting for an update so that it can record 4k video and slow mo.. very poorscreen cast not workingspeaker not goodworst phoneblessing unlucky to have it. battery drain fastly have been a lenovo fan , but this k8 note is not a great phone in terms of comfort of handling....it is very slippery and does not fit into our hands...screen replacement costs rs.5500/- for a phone of 14k.... battery life is better but not as per the claims...ui is good.. bought this for me and redmi note 4for my wife....looks redmi note4 scores hands down i m purchase this phone.phone looking best but 1. two sim+ memory don\\'t use .2.you use only 15 minute phone are hot..3.sound quality not satisfaction.... overall phone r very bed phone.......... i feel cheated by lenovo.please dont buy this phone.it may have a good hardware, but stock android provided with k8 is just intolerable.let me just jot down few of the many reasons1. no inbuilt call recording facility.2. no scheduled power on/off option.3. no gallery, u have to use google\\'s photo app instead.4. it takes a long time to show a flashy lenovo animation, which is truly a waste if time for me. u need to root ur phone to change it.5. the call log stores only last 3 call details for each caller.6. at the back, the dual camera, which boasts of capturing depth of field, is a crap. it shoots out of focus photos more often than a sharp one and only shoots in bright light.( i have thoroughly clicked many snaps with that option.)7. no inbuilt app for selecting other themes.8. battery of 4000mah doesn\\'t perform well. it hardly lasts 16hrs with a heavy use of internet(wifi/mobile data)9. the product comes with a clear tag \\'with new system update\\' - but till date i have neither received any software/system update nor have i been notified about it. and i am worried if it (oreo update) brings up new issues of malfunctioning as reported widely in different forums.i feel so tired of writing these \\'cons\\' about k8, that it will be difficult to explain its \\'pro\\'s after this.amazon has been good as always in delivery. screen cast not working all features are good except the screen quality. i have kept it in my mobile pocket while driving. when i have taken it back in my hand i have seen cracks in screen. i have seen the videos saying screen is strong but it is not. for replacing screen lenovo authorised service centres are mentioning different prices in different service centre. one lenovo service centre quoted 8500. another lenovo service centre quoted 5800 fab👍 i like it .... produce too much heat, battery performance not up to the mark, picture quality average, so i will suggest others not to buy this product, you will get better product at this price. nice phone...love it.. nice smart phone run softly this time lenovo k8 note not give us a good quality camera.images are blure while we click and not sure about depth. good phone pathetic experience with the product. it heats up to 43 degree and battery drains out in just 2 hours after full charge. volte not compatible, heating issues are main problem.. missing headset to in moblie it is a good phone. drawbacks are that it drains battery and data rates on 4g is slower than on redmi note4 super android wid lots of features its specially fr gamers good best mobile set...i\\'ve ever seen! bit of heating but other than that it\\'s bomb phone is awesome its rear camera is good front camera is so good recommend for selfie lover....but its dual camera feature is low in order to select background and focus on objecti think it will be updated in next versioncharger is so good ..... v. good product.battery backup is good.but camera quality isn\\'t good. dis product is good product quality is worst, with in one and half month ear speaker and micro phone is not working properly. i never expected such a poor quality of this lenova product the handset appears to be an old one.the back cover on the handset is also a scratched one.no original glass cover is supplied at the time of new supply of a handset whereas it has not so happened . the name of the handset written on the back of also appears to be wiped.so doubts arises.plz clarify with satisfaction unless i shall be bound to return the purchased hand set . i have required invoice of my product again... it\\'s a fantastic device. very happy with this deal. very heat worst phone ever. battery backup is too bad. network catching power not so well. good product heating issue, gets heated even with use of camera gaming ..10/9camera ..10/7display .and sound quality..10/9.5phone looks .10/5finger print 10/8battery..10/7. average this mobile is good in terms of battery life (2days), camera quality, turbo charging (full charge in 1hr). this mobile has finger print sensor lock and 4gb ram , free of hanging. not friendly, the phone is doing great in terms of camera quality, sound quality, looks. however i doubt the battery is 4000 mah. it even last a day. is it really a 4000 mah battery? bhut accha handset hai but mujhe ye ptaa nhi chal raha hai ki dual camera open kaisa hota hai first of all this phone have heatting problem secondly the camera dose not capture the photo very fast you have to wait for 4-5 second for that and third the games are not working smoothly so i prefer you don\\'t buy this phone at this budget very waste camera quality.... so nice dovice some issue in phone like google media player not fateching song from sd card any one can tell me hoe to fix this issue. and u cant select ringtone except company ringtone, u can but u hv to move ur ringtone in internal ringtone folder. bokeh effect not proper work. music sound is not loudly compare to lenovo k4 note.ni8 mode brightness is not here. front camera is pretty good compare to rear. its good...

performance...i am satisfied.. heating problem there have been a lots of negative rating for this phone and i was quite skeptical about buying it.if you are checking this phone out, let me clear some myth.1) the phone doesn\\'t really heat up as much as people are saying, it is nominal heating when playing games.2) jio/volte/4g works smoothly.3) the phone doesn\\'t lag at all.4) the dual camera is not a pain in the neck.5) call recording works well with the boldbeast recorder app.6) battery life is awesome7) it takes 2 hours to charge the battery, not 5-6 except for when it is first time.if you are buying for the dolby atmos. press back right now and look at k5 vibe.update : after latest update bluetooth a2dp doesn\\'t work. third class product... the first one i got with problem in camera

amazing the device is good at speed, interface and battery life. but the application provided is little clumsy. it won\\'t allow the contacts to be stored in device memory. for everything it demands a google account. good camera quality what a performance!i own iphone 6s 64gb.fortunately and unfortunately i must say...lenovo impressed me a lot in terms of camera,speed,battery and many other things.thanks amazon great phonevalue for money battery drains very fast superb mobile...i love it, excellent waste mobile, my mobile ear spekar not working, not available return. nice device. not facing ny problem. turbo charging helps.performace is gr8. camera too are gd selfie comes gr8 n reaer camera also clicks good. but lenovo should provide inbuilt gallery and music player in this lenovo k8 note. i need to download from app store. i have not received good product. my mobile is heating after charging and talking.one more thing automatically other no will merge with other no .may be contact app have some problem. i am not totally satisfied with this product. first impressions is last impressionsthis mobile is not. good because i received it and problem inside mobile

quick, awesome product...i\\'m fully satisfied.... very nice. not a great phone does not live up to the hype. charger makes a hissing sound, notification light does not work properly. very disappointed with this phone should have bought the nokia 6 only good phone... buy it without worry... no overheating ...yes u dont find ear piece coz notbavailable with this phonr.. gallery u hv to dwnld ... n battery percentage is not showing.on top of rhe screen ..these are drawbacks u can easily manage with.. go for it ✌ its nice best phone in this price range. superb. value for money. overall its quite a good phone when compared to others in its segment and certainly one cant compare this one with one plus... or samsung/apple high end phones. but then, lenovo can improve in this segment by providing lte+lte support for both the sim slots. otherwise, if one is thinking on not investing more on a mobile phone, as the technology changes rapidly, this one is a good bet. mobile feature was good but depth camera must improve received a defective speaker. worth the value for money. mobile phone and it\\'s features are awesome. but it slipped from 3 ft distence and it\\'s gorilla glass 4 broken. it was not delivered properly. i received delivered confirmation without received. i send mails. spoke directly to customer care and finally got my phone.rest cameras are fine. featured phone. i can suggest you to buy it. but please get it protected first,then use. too much heating .....other than its good good mobile very nice but cash back 15% not recieved in amazon pay camera is not good battery is not good best phone. good battery life. and fast charging. lenovo k8 note will defeat redmi note 4 because camera is very much good. split screen,at a time you can use both dual sim and memory card more important selficamer with flash. good****** fantastic phone out 2 slim slot one is not working heating problem during charging i am not received headphone. its good small problems in touchscreen camera click makes a big sound as if an old camera of 1950\\'s was working! there is no ear phone cord with the package and software space left out of 4 gb ram after minimal pre-installed software is too small. performance is just ok. rest of it is being explored still, as i got the delivery on 23.10.17. charger cable is shorter this time than it has been with lenovo previously, perhaps to cut costs. not a phone to be proud of in this price segment.some negative features of amazon cannot be blamed on lenovo.phone heats up quickly. i just checked it twice. avoid it. i downgraded it further from \" so-so\" to \"cheap\".sajad ahmed 1. heating issue.2. battery backup is not good.3.phone is too weight.kindly give me process to replace this mobile. my jio sim is not working in this device.when the phone is idle you will not able to receive any call.all my contacts complained me your phone was not reachable but i told them my phone was in working condition.so i am very disappointed by this phone. battery drain fast, camera is ok.. cemera quality is very low this phone don\\'t have many simple function like call recording, save contact in phone memory or sim card, lock apps with finger print, music player(only google play).it should update these functions good speed,camera quality worst primary camera okgood battery lifetill now mobile did not stuck let\\'s see in future overall everything good, but screencast doesn\\'t work and its a major downside. very good the product may seem of good specs, but after 4 months of use, it has gone from worse to worst.call reception quality, gps signal being lost, internet connectivity all are being worsttttt. pl dont do the same mistake i did. best every good phone, a value for what you pay. fantastic at performance, acceptable camera quality for this price range. good phone... it\\'s been more than 6 months since using this phone...initially phone used to switch off when you put it into 100%charge...later updates fixed the issue. cheap phone with high end package.worth the money worst item i ever bought in my life... it has lots of problem one by one... having problem with connection to laptop over wifi. amazone gave me replacement. same problem there in replacement too. it connects some time with its mood. rrmaining time we hve to struggle. we cant say when it connects. god knows. lenovo k8note very good condition and must look good smartphone for stock rom lovers. battery gave some problems in starting but after 1 month everything got good. heating problem is there in lenovo k8 note in this range its a great phone. but processor is very fast as compared to honor 8,9and redmi note 4 mi max 2 and another phone. battery backup is also very good.40% for 2 days i used in wifi and mobile network with calling this product was really superb i am happy. but amazon customer care is not support its very bad wrk for amazon. because i already my lenovo phone battery drain complained in customer care but now time was not contact for me. great mobile and on time delivery from amazon. lenovo - sleek model and produces a great performance. battery backup is not as expected or guaranteed by the company hifi sound system not avilable iam not satisfied this prodect i am very happy using lenovo k8 notethanks amazon\\'s product is good and awsm 1 mobile good but battery drains very fast 2 can\\'t set gallery ringtone 3 no inbuilt music player only one speaker is working. what should i do ,purchased 2 days ago it\\'s an awesome phone 📱, no doubt 🤷\\u200d♂️ you can buy it. 👍 👍👍 its working good but suddenly hang it. but overall good product.when was i get my cash back money,i was waiting for that. very good product in this price. not as expected, lenovo k4 note is far better than this, my phone battery is getting low so i need some help screen flickers in low brightness..hope lenovo resolves this soon. network cathing not goodit is poor and not user friendly very good i liked the phone but have not received as what mentioned in description it states clearly in \"whats in the box handset, 2 piece 15w turbo charger and usb cable\" i have just received 1 piece 15w turbo charger and usb cable. please guide me how to claim for the other piece. it works fast cast screen is also not working and found the same complaint from several customers on lenovo portal all phones of k8 sires are def and dumb. did a research and spoke with lenovo tech agent and found this is a \"stock android\" os based phone thus customer needs to make a additional hardware purchase for google cromecast dongle to make cast screen, this information they should provide while selling this. yellow light of camera- who makes flash light with yellow light that\\'s too for rear camera photographs. amazon has lied to me for the return of this product. had to reset phone same day since google service was not working even other applications were also got crashed. after phone reset it is giving the same problem. camera is very poor darn bad, don\\'t go for this phone. with 13 mp you cannot take 16:9 photos and it\\'s very poor feature when comes to take in depth photograph. over all bad phone single camera is better then dual camera with 13&5 mp cameras which cannot shoot full screen or 16:9 photographs. if i could rate this experience to day as append with

found this set very comparable and nice. in my opinion lenovo k8 note is not as good as my lenovo k6 power. before i bought this phone i saw the advertisement of lenovo k8 note which shows that lenovo k8 has a very high quality of camera and also has a good quality of speakers but actually in my experience my lenovo k6 power\\'s quality of sound is far far much better and also has a high volume boost then this handset my this purchase is somewhat very disappointing as i have paid a great deal of money thank you it is the best . super performance an efficient lenovo k8 note is good looking. nice finishing body. camera is good but not like too good.main issue is very hot back side in charge battery & internet use & movies watching.price is high. quality & sounds are to good. this mobile is very nice great phone for this much price. i have been using this phone widout a screen guard not a scratch on the screen. i keep my phone with keys n all in my pocket .as for performance dont know about gaming but yeah you can open a lot of common apps without a lag. the build quality is great and tough one. very worst phone. heats more and drained battery with in half day mobile is good killer

they recommended to send it back for replacement. as per amazon check app device is \"perfect\" i don\\'t understand who is right. amazon or lenovo service station. lenovo k8 note is very fast mobile and 4gb ram 64gb rom and performance is very well and so many fast and camera as front camera 13mp and black camera dule camera 5mp and 13mpvenom black so beautiful looking. most important feature - camera is not good.at all. camera is good on papers only not in real.battery backup is not good after 3 months and its taking 6 hours plus for full charging.performance lags as compared to k3. experience your expectations for this price screen cast doesn\\'t works..recomends chrome cast,and no call recording option. bad, emits nd system ui is not responding, very slow in clicking pics. bad bad. it\\'s too good phone but 3 minus point is battery capacity 4000 mah but it\\'s not capable 4000 if u r continued used bettery used so fastly and charging is turbo so long lasting time need and second if u r enable fingerprint sensor ur battery used fastly and heat mobile in ur pocket... third is in back camera is not stable b\\'coz autofacous not available then many photos clicked blur... but camera features are good ... natural photography finally it\\'s good phone by cost and features that price not available any other phones ...i think my way it\\'s excellent .... good product after

great sound experience donot buy this.i wud tell u why.1.phone is ok from all perspectives be it camera speaker call battery display.nothing to be blown off in any category.2.lenovo promised to give regular updates to it as it is near stock android so i purchased.now after a single software patch der has not been any updates.not even monthly security patch.last was september 5.3.lenovo is lenovo.a big bitch or a thief or a dacoit u can say as dey belong to china.dey hav time and again proved it.all reviewers and youtubers u can watch video.lenovo k5 note k6 note p2 all hones wer told

this.but they jept mum.so i thot ill review on amazon. camera doesn\\'t work.... even basic features are missing. returns policy is a sham with lots of unacceptable and hidden conditions devised to make return of defective phones (especially this one) impossible. even with high-speed connections, wi-fi speed is terrible. great con job by lenovo and amazon. unhappy to buy this product as i received the product next day product prices drop by 2000 ₹ no value product awesome phone but there is some lags in gaming... very poor .third class qulity.hanging problem ... very nice phone camera is really good but could have been better...with software update this phone could become really good and for this value its an amazing phone...there are some minor bugs but overall amazing it\\'s very nice phonecamera is also very goodjust waiting for it\\'s android updatefrom nougat to oreo sound problem, battery problem i have buy this item before 3 month and now facing problem like battery drain, too much heating, and phone hanging so much.my worst experience this product. the phone is worth buying! till now i haven\\'t experienced any problems turn off the google assistant. the battery of this phone will last one day with full internet usage. front camera is awesome. rear camera is really disappointing. contacts management is very bad, battery is very good & processor is fast. cast is not working, not good as the specs . no need to buy. can go for other better model. no use of dual camera. photo clarity is same. panorama does not work. only one speaker works good switch from iphone 6+ to this! the phone display now changed some vrtical lines are displaying and brightness reduced is there any chance to replace it .i want replace.pls give me advice. there is a battery problem in this phone , it only works 2-4 hours ...please do resolve the issue immediately or return its 1 of the worst phone ever from lenovo, after oero update am getting battery backup around 3 hours ! yes 3 hours, camera is worst poor quit good. camera & sound are a bit disappointing. bad mobile, sim not working music key not working sim setting issue. looks great excellent service. delivered as mentioned. mobile is heating during playing game.hence i not satisfied with this product. charger not working very gud phone...fast everything..no hang...battery drains little fast...full charge gives about 15hrs of usage(including watching videos,calls,text, browser at 4g)..front camera is very gud...rear one is a big ok.. mobile is ok according to the price there are few issues with the phone. phone is getting stuck at times. the time in the notification bar does not change until the phone is locked and then unlocks. whatsapp will show online even though it is not used. whatsapp blue tick is not coming for some message even though message is read. overall it\\'s good in budget...call voice is comparatively low, dolby is not up to the mark. product as such not so good no feel of value for money don\\'t buy this plz .the lens of the back camera is not good after 2 mounth it\\'s take bad picture.ami it has helio x20 processer . honor is best and moto good device@ good price

sufficiently good camera. working without any problem. about packaging and delivery :received the phone on next day as i had paid extra for 1 day delivery but the packaging through which i received the phone was extremely poor.able to see the phone box thoroughly from outside because of poor amazon cover packaging.about phone :i am writing this review after 3 months of usage of phone.pros :* it has all the features you want to buy like 12 sensors, fast fingerprint detect, front flash. on april 28th 2018 received the android 8.0.0 os update.dont know whether lenovo is going to provide further updates or not.*battery life is of 2 and half days if mobile data is off and if mobile data is on battery will empty within 15 hrs after heavy use.*phone built quality is good but not that great.*camera performance is average.*it takes 2 hrs to 2hrs 30 minutes time for charging if battery low at 15 % or below. soemtimes while charging it shows 5 hrs or 6hrs or 1day time to charge the phone.but after restart the actual charging time shows.*sound quality due to dolby atmos is very good. without it sound is low.*processor and ram are good. there is no lagging observed.cons :* phone is giving heating issues in between and after restart its temperature gets to normal.*sometimes called person unable to hear voice as the mic is on down side so need to bring down the phone towards your mouth to talk.mobile signal quality is good performance is good ....but battery does not feel like a 4000mah kind. looks are boring and the camera isn\\'t that rich in terms of quality...yaaa but it is a good buy for 12000...can compare and make your choice...🤞 how can i complained for my mobile is not good working many user interface issue, loophole, also heating problem and battery backup

signal is too poor in this.... used for 8 months.. cool phone. now got oreo update avg camera this product lenovo k8 note keeps on charging without getting fully charged even though it is supposed to have a turbo charger. this mobile has got charging problems. since my product return date was 29th sept, i am now saddled with this defective product :-( :-( :-( we started using this mobile from 30th sept even though we got delivery a week earlier since it was my for my sons bday. its fine. better product 4 gb ram... 64 gb wao its fantastic the headphone doesnt fit in the jack properly. i have tried 3.5 mm earphones from 3 different brands. is it a manufacturing defect? awesom worst battery, and features..menu options is not good, whis sms can\\'t make vcard attachment, compare with mi note 4 all features is worse.. booked on 18, got it delivered on 20. using it for 4 days, awesome experience well after using it for 20 days..pros:1)good camera both front and back2)sleek design3) screen is way too good and vibrant.4) fingerprint sensor is fast5) fast charging is super awesomecons:1)it is not able to play heavy games flawlessly.. the game lags.. and injustice lags a lot..so not recommended for gaming2)battery backup is not too good..like redmi note 4 despite having same battery capacity bcz of mediatek processoe3)mediatek is not as good as snapdragon..4)bokeh effect is not so reliable..it captures awesome photos some time and the other times its of no use.till now no heating issues found. good phone....everything nice...nice camera..batery backup is not so good...and there is also heating issue while using the camera(especially in depth mode)and while charging..otherwise nice phone in this price. it\\'s working as expected.don\\'t u think it would be to too early to right a review for a cell phone.at least 10 days for a cell phone. wifi and hotspot problem not able to connect with other device nor detected by another device nice phone after new update battery and camera improved this mobile is heating problem more and not charge fast 1hr in 17% only or not battery backup battery life discharging not more than a day or even less and other app feature like cast to tv is not working 😔 its good i got my k8 note two days before yesterday.... the phone was defective ...there was lots of cache ...and seems like someone used it ... because cache generation is only due to processing of the phn ....the screelock was not working ....after clearing cache it started working .... the wallpaper blacked out ( means interface freeze) on the first day ... the phn is highly unstable ...the software is also not working properly... dont buy it ...and also ..amazon\\'s customer service agents are just giving me the excuse of proper process of returning..... they are just trying to get rid of the scenario..... poor product bought this phone on 25th got it delivered by 27th and after using it for a week can say that the phone features and speed is good. sound is good ,back camera is good after ota update front camera is average. battery survives through the day and charges to 100% in about one and a half hour. the major issue which i faced was network issues for the incoming calls . for which have to return the phone to amazon else the phone was good . probably that defect might have been only on my handset. anyways getting the refund so not much of worry . after using the phone for 4 months. i am disappointed.there is problem in bluetooth. not works properly with bluetooth speaker.can lenovo give update for this? bad cameras... i am using lenovo k8 note and found that this is useless phone very poor processor heat too much phone looks good and screen is good too. but the battery is poor. even though it is of 4000 mah capacity, it doesn\\'t even last for 24 hours. even though the brand says that there is turbo charging, it actually takes 3 hours to charge fully. so basically you will need to charge your phone twice in a day for 3 hours each time. good handling and best technology for motorola ltd india is the best don\\'t buy this product, i brought it last year in december, just after 3 months, started having heating problems and phone turning off, then eventually it stopped working, went to service center, they said motherboard problems, but they don\\'t have motherboard currently to change it, so after waiting for quite a few days, took it back and showed it at another place, then also not repaired, then again gave to service center, they said warranty is over as its opened outside, then i said i will pay for whatever repair there is, they said motherboard cost 14,500, that\\'s even more than the cost of phone now, so now that phone is wastage, company is just nicking customers because they priced its parts so high that no one would go for repair, so recommend not to go for this phone or you will regret it fluctuating wifi receiving signals. wifi gets disconnected too frequently within my home. i also have motorola phone with which i donot face this wifi drop so frequently. signals dropping is very irritating and frustrating while working online screen cast not working in lenovo k 8 noteplease update this issue by lenovo good this product which i got was break and i want it get back return. good good bang for the buck.. the phone\\'s specifications are simply too good for the price.overall performance is good. camera is excellent. the deca core processor results in superior and enhanced performance. battery life is also excellent. amazing delivery by amazon !!love the product. vry worst phone i have seen ever the battery is draining very very fast so much prblems in phone i hv done everg thing for the batry backup but no any solution for this problem i suggest u to not buy this phone! needs improvement in some areas like camera performance and battery performance mobile is heating heated while charging.i have reported this on 17 jan-18 at night.technical agent has performed diagnosed test on that day & temperature was proper as per application but my hardware very still hot at that time & he told me some body will pick up my phone on friday but nobody came till now.now again i have given call to them then another agent told me that in the report nothing is mention about return & test is right.amazon is not able to provide proper service earlier i was thinking to replace mobile with them not i definitely wants to return phone.i don\\'t trust their technical agent now.if any one is facing issue please make sure amazon provides proper service to them.i dont have issues with lenovo k8,there is no replacement guaranteed from amazon.they are able to build report on app basis .if app shows proper result then then mobile is proper.if this mobile is available in

performance, hanging issue, network issue, restart automatically, after 15 minut using it warm very quick. and its hase media tack processor. good for look so good video playback is overly sharp (saturated) and dark. anyone else facing this issue please reply im using the phone best phone best smartphonene and quick service of amezon. signal problem.. disappointed the phone is good enough but sometimes facing some issues regards to back touch, whenever i try that you need touch 5-8 times or restart the phone.. camera not satisfied just avg .slightly gets heatdisplay no great

picture quality not good.. it was very good product dual camera is fake ,upside camera was not working,it just fix for show(for design) nice it\\'s great mobile in very good prize everything is good except the time it takes for charging . it takes forver to charge . easily 4-5 hours to go from 5%-100% turbo charging is definitely a lie amazing phone lenovo k8 note 0 star for battery and 0 star overall very poor performance no call record support.worst phone in my life.amazon not even support to customer to return or replace phone within time period.they are cheateded us. mobile so much. heating very poor mobile. wastege of money.despite having 4 gb of ram the phone gets hangs. after 1 month battery backup get dull. app loading time is very low . phone speed also get slow after 1 month of use. performance wise is very good.. sound, browsing speed is very.good. camera is ok.i could see there is frequent flickering with blue&white screen of lenovo logo. it’s been a while i have been using this phone. i am happy with the phone features. it has excellent battery but the primary camera is not up to the mark. despite the dual rear camera the picture are not clear as you would want them to be. awesome device i bought this, the turbo charger worked for first 2 hrs after that it took 7 hrs to charge mobile. i had to replace. the second item also was the same. turbo charger takes too much time to charge mobile heats very much..after clicking photos,after charging.it always heats up so much that unable to hold or use the phone fabulous amazing,,awesome . phone...i bought it today on. 02.09.2017really satisfied of this. when i brought this phone within 2 days phone was totally hanged no button working , it was unable to restart and switch off.. according to my perspective this phone is worst.. dolby atoms always stops automatocally, dual camera is of no use , very low volume for headphone, overall performance is not soo good.. mobile super one problem no quick charging ...2hours and 10mins full charge good one but not the best one... mi a1 is better in looks and camera tuch glass cracked device too high hitting & hang awsm mobile.... beautiful camera,fast charging,good battery backup great phone.....blindly go for it....you wont repent....trust me hangs very often as ram management is not proper. further android o update delayed by a large amount of time.not to mention the useless dual camera which does not improve the photos at all. product is good but one bad things earphone is not given in box awesome mobile.. powerful hardware...cast screen .. enable wireless display not available..latest update effects bluetooth and wifi not working properly these disconnects while it connect...camera is averagebattery backup above average...no ir and no nfc ... very good mobile handset best product bad camera my phone battery drains faster then expected. phone start automatic restart after 3 months of purchase and battery drain so quickly on the top of that amazon wont repair and replace this faulty phone even its still unde warranty worst service by amazon and lennovo power full processing and nice camera phon great performance with dual camera and selfie camera, processor,speed this item is not satisfied my expectations. excess heat issue. poor camera quality and less speaker quality. return process process also not good. i feel very bad on purchasing this mobile from amazon and lenovo it\\'s excellent working i am very happy.. product is really amazing it quickly heats up this phone is with turbocharger but till mobile is taking approx 2:45 min for charge and this phone is little slow in process very good product and delivered before the expected date. very good phone... most importantly it will get o update online no no purched rs. ka pata nahi kab high to low nakli hai.13999 ka do din baad 11999 good very bad product hanging problem automatic off not start again . no system gallery in phone. not at all recommended. my lenovo k8 has the following issues:1. poor signal strength - tried different sims like vodafone, jio, etc, but signal shows only 2-3 bars. whereas the same sims when inserted in other 4g handsets, it shows full strength n no call drops.2. heating problem: the company has added 4000 mah battery because they knew that this handset will get heated and drained battery quickly. on using simple day-to-day work, it gets heated like anything. and the full battery drains within half day.3. slow performance: even after introduced 4gb ram, the handset is slow. it\\'s not clear n not declared which type of 4 ram they have inserted.i ordered the first day of its launch at amazon. and one of the early users. but my overall expectations are not met... and not satisfied with the money i spent. super value for money..al though depth mode takes time to shoot but results are good enough for a budget phone a good hardy device nicely priced.. processor ok but device gets warm when used a little heavier.... camera good... overall a nice budget phone from lenovo....... nice have been using this since 3 weeks. cool to have a deca-core processor.no lag ,no performance issues. i have not tested graphic intensive games yet. biggest drawback for me is no direct screen cast to smart tv unlike other competitors. bokeh feature of the camera is not perfect. not good one 2 weeks after getting the phone, it stopped working. it is switched off and does not switch on by any means. i did not get cashback front camera quality is poor in nightsound is superb.display is sharp and clear.back camera needs some improvement. i am lenovo lover.i bought my last 3 phone from lenovo but this time i disappointed.lenovo k8 note have many software issue.many features are missing compare to k4 note.i seems k4 note is advance then k8 note.just camera is good... rest all features are below.1. battery draining problem2. you can not adjust volume of notifications.3. cast screen not working.4. call receiving problem(you have to unlock phone to check person name on screen)5. you can not change theme.6. call history only show hours not actual time.7. volte not supported.only 4g8. back button is opposite side .9. you can not delete all contacts from phone.you have to select one by one.10. msg settings has no options.11. battery is not showing in percentage.12. you will not find 100 % singnal in phone.it always show half signals.13. call dialing time is more compare to others mobile. waste mobile ,i had buy this mobile but mobile performance is too very worst perfect phone. cheap and best. at times while charging it gets heater. other than that this is the best phone you could get for this budget. the best phone in the range.pros:*turbo-fast charging* dolby atmos sound system* in-built compass* google assistant* fingerprint sensor, of course.*complete package for ms office* split screen for vrcons:*average camera quality* poor slow-mo capture* android n (inspite of the updated tags)cut to the case, it\\'s one of the best cell phones you can get in the price. great battery with heavy usageawesome front cameraa little heavyfast chargingawesome display best phone in this price.awesome bettery and camera.may be some people expecting iphone in this price thats why they are disappointed with this phone. super only one turbo charger is given. camera is very nice super quality then super my first order in amazon it\\'s was very amazing lenovo k8 note is not up to the mark... to be called killerbettery drains fastnetwork riception not goodthink before u buy it...there many cons in this phone good but the screen broke faster camera quality not up to mark , audio jack not working , phone does not lock by power button ......good battery performance it is disappointing to see such a poor performing product from a well known brand. wifi stopped working within a month . turbo charger does not charge the phone as fast as claimed. took the phone to the service centre they say it\\'s a hardware issue and will take 1 week to repair. very poor after sales support from lenovo, how can some one give their phone for repair for 1 week. i wouldnt recommend buying this phone sabase badhiya phone excellent headphone is not available with packing. are u looking here ?? ..dnt worry ..its the best phone in this price range , i bought it for 12k handset is just good can\\'t give it 5 out of 5.pros:1.design is awsome good looking2. phone response is also good.3. screen is awsome.cons:1. it\\'s heated on calls and charging.2. camera effect.. don\\'t expect much just because of dual camera it only gives you certain option such as blur background or change it.3. 40000 mh battery is not going to help you a lot..it\\'s not providing you a long life phone is diacharged with in 7-8 hours if you are using internet (obviously that you will).4. here is some problem with files stored in phone also.memory is being occupied with unnecessary things.after all i can conclude that phone is good durable good looking..but you should not expect any magical things with it. as it\\'s just higher than the normal smart phones. 1) mobile camera clarity is very poor (age detector is not available and photo date option not available)2) mobile battery back is very low3) mobile network signal frequency also very bad jio sim is not work proper everything seems fine... but i am unable to find selective b&w focus optioncan anyone plz help me with this stuff?? i suggest to all the people who are planning for this mobile is ....it\\'s not worth the money .camera not good ,battery is the worst and some time it is freezing ,phone is heavy , never used this kind of useless os ,no short cut for switching on blutooth or other featuresbattery does not come for a day alsoto close all apps need to open the go to top this is useless featurebluetooth breaks while traveling in the carhotspot sometimes shows and somtime not ...depends upon luckbattery does not come for a day inspite of closing all the applicationscreen freezesno call recording option like it\\'s a good product.but sometimes it hangs or its touch does not work.but all over it\\'s a good device. this item is not working properly this is second i got replaced due to same reason & again the same issue with phone. bluetooth is not working properly overall good one for the price do not buy this phone, got hanged and heated definitely not a good choice. i purchased this product with high hopes but it didn\\'t meet the needs.battery drains out fast. i charged to full in morning and with a normal usage it dropped to 25% by 2pm.next is the issue of heating on even minimal usage.i am planning to return it.sorry lenovo. nice good one this price awesome worth buying 😍 3.5 mm audio jack is not working from the beginning itself. photo which had taken in normal camera was not good enough.i installed another cam app to take photos . awesome nice phone !! all features are working very well and its just.wow... fabulous product xcellent phone vd all stuff loaded. battery awesome.. never faced any issue till now from month time.. thanks amazon for this amazing product... bluetooth audio ,cast screen not working ,dolby atoms problems rellay not satisfied good good earphone nhi nikle paking mai..... i didn\\'t install any games, i didt listen to any music. whats app or facebook not installed,fresh phone was fully charged and battery didnt last for one complete day. handset gives you slightly heavy feeling.back button is on your left. when compared to k4 speakers, i dont like this single speaker.yet to check the camera but i hope its good. figerprint sensor is really fast and very accurate.for this price, i think this should be a good phone. nice phone i have used it for a month now. and so far it has worked really well. the midiatech processer works perfectly. the camera is really good . this is to good 4 star because of , camera clearity is very good but not an excellent...it should/can be better than this...👍bcz lenovo is a good company..👍 superb phone and specially gorilla glass, my mobile fallen just from 2ft height and the rest is with the attchment awesome phone ,nice camera,have all features for students like microsoft\\'s app n google easy to handle.... nice phone in budget. very fast. compare to redmi it\\'s far better. lenovo front camera is little discouraged. it\\'s fast but it\\'s not gra 5minute v chalane ke bad heat ho jata hai aur sub best hai but heat hone ki samasya aapko presan kar dega. nice look. gd battery bjp, little observation- receiver speaker voice is low.except it all good. charger folt camera not good.heating issues. heating problem nice... good good. received before the targeted time nice... phone.. few features are missing from my old phone lenovo vibe k4 note... had those features was present in this phone it would be awesome... lenovo k8 note is not good for daily use pl dont bye it pl pl pl request lenovo k8note note cons battery consumes too much sometimes it gets heat while using mobile around 2 hours approx earphones sound is lesser than others phone call mike issue is there sometime voice not coming to me properly then i have to open jio net,call recording is not there one more issue is there camera blurs redmi note 4 camera better than lenovo k 8 note as i compared that time i didn\\'t believe i was shocked to see redmi note 4 images i am waiting for upadation on lenovo, lenovo should gets new update for these cons otherwise pros this mobile has dolby sound , video quality is pretty good,lookwise nice premium phone, turbo charger, gorilla glass,splash resistant,faster net speed,music key, nice fone, great no led notification for whatsapp and missed call performance is good, camera is excellent at this price range....both in depth mode ( dual rear cameras ) or without it... selfie camera is also very good and the flash is an added bonus...the only drawback and a big, quite major one is the battery.....it says it\\'s 4000 mah but it is hardly worthy of 2500 mah...it really is dat bad.....hardly lasts 10-12 hrs....dat too with moderate use....n so called fast charging is bad n inconsistent...at times it charges in around 1% in 1 min but mostly it takes like 7-8 min for 1% charge.....dats too bad....feel like returning it honestly just because of dis issue.... very good product for best price... thanks amazon...//// charger not working after 6 months usage it\\'s good good poor charging...i think i got duplicate charger. please don\\'t purchase this phone vry good nd xcellent design nd luk battery is too bad.. product is not good, voice is not clear, while talking in a line by the screen touch it is operating (auto dilling, auto entering in to the applications, call is holding,) camera also not that clarity as it should be, getting very difficulty while connecting wi-fi. etc...... totally a waste of good money. lenovo should be banned from selling cell phones in india. the camera quality is hopeless. the atmos feature is a gimmick, worthless even though i use sony apk70 head phones which are some of the best. the battery drain is heavy. i bought this phone for the price and camera it offered. i am thoroughly disappointed. this is my last lenovo product. this is not a subjective review. my a7000 was a far better performer overall. worst very disappointed with mobile performance , within one month started hanging, lenovo looks nice design , the battery gets charge quickly but the performance of the battery is too bad it\\'s not sustain fullday (while online). heat issues , low camera quality, getting heat up a lot even when not on charging. display hangs sometimes. ok fine good product how to check dual camera setup ??? both are working or not ?? awesome phoneit hangs in 6 monthsheating issuegreat camera poor experience !! i hv to switch off my phone in order to charge it ...bcoz when i charge it in a normal way (in switch on mode) battery hardly charges 10% in 1hour ...battery also drains quickly nice mobile it\\'s ok not best ear speaker is not working please don\\'t buy from amazon help me for return nice battery usage phone super hai but charging issue h bahut dheere charge hota h phone good but rear camera pic quality is like vga camera. i returned this mobile. very good very good mobile ram very fast camera good look very nice screen good also very good handset from lenovo. love it. very good performance. sound quality is excellent. i don\\'t like the body of the phone, it\\'s look like a cheap phone but features are good and working fine. i\\'m disappointed by look n feel. very good mobile phone amazing phone with very less price & always the prime service by amazon is amazing !!!!!!!!!!!! i have bought just 13 days back. it is getting very much heat without any reasons and taking 10 to 15 hours to get full charge. it is giving very much heat while charging even. please don\\'t buy this model, it will be waste of money which i feel. beautifull product good good hi got this phone, looks good.1. no heating2. full charge takes 3hrs for me3.at a only one sim act as 4g and other sim as 3g4.charger wire and headset insert pin very tight while plug in and plug out dolby atmos is not working so i have retrun mobile excellent product good expense everything is fine... but camera is worst.... i am writing this review after 7 months of usagein the package: mobile, turbo charging adapter, usb cable, plastic case, normal screen guard, sim ejector toolcamera: good for photos and videos in this pricing segment for daylight images. struggles when it comes to night photography. slow motion video recording is defiantly not up to the mark.os: got the system update, lenovo keeps sending the software updates time to time. despite keeping the software of the phone up to date the performance of the phone is not up to the mark> phone & contacts (both are default) apps doesn\\'t work some times takes 30 to 40 sec to load the screen> any app be it facebook, instagram etc., handgs once in a day due to phone performance issues (what is the point of having 4 gb ram)> heating issue when playing heavy games like asphalt 8 and the app hangs giving worst gaming experiencebattery:4000 mah battery, takes 3 hours to charge from 0% to 100% with the turbo charger provided. if you are a heavy user battery comes for 6 to 8 hours else it might come for 12 hours at max.phone speaker: not loud enough while playing music out, also while in traffic you can\\'t hear the calls, absolutely not even a single word. speaker sucks really nice.. expect for the ram & internal memory the function of this k8 note is far below previous k4 note which iam using presently. the camera is very poor and dolby atmos function is totally useless again when compared to k4 note. i expected too much and thought will be better than k4 note in all terms. extra features like flip phone power off, full screen photo,in built dolby function present in k4 not available in k8. single speaker is totally poor when compared to twin speakers in k4. hmmm good simply awesome device very good good phone. but the offer of rs 343/- with idea is not working. idea team is telling handset lenovo k8 note is not supporting this offer. disappointed with camera. camera quality is not up to the mark and it is too slow to capture photo when flash is on. all the features are awesome. bad experience better experience of a stock android good battery backup selfie camera is good back camera is want to improve... and so on the phone has a good look with marvellous finishing...the camera quality is awesome...the battery performance is upto the level.. even there is only speaker grill ,the sound quality is good worst by lenovo.. worst buy big mistake this is a horrible phone, it\\'s just 10 days since purchased. the phone hangs often. zero rating for this awful instrument. product is really awesome i like the battery backup. but the screen quality is not so good and it\\'s not up to the mark. but phone is really good. there were so many features are missing, where when we compare to other lenovo phone.battery is not much worthy and it is been mentioned 4000 mah but the battery back up is too low.there was lot of bugs were seen in one day usage itself.finger print is working fine.camera is also good and great,design of the mobile phone is good.a dedicated memory card slot is very good and we can use both sim and a memory card. that one of the biggest advantage in thisin overall, it is not worthy for 13k mobile, if more features are been added ,may be it can be worthy for that amount heating problem in mobile and battery quality is so poor. satisfactory network connectivity is poorcamera is not as expected (given the hype)need a screenshot button in the status bar and an call recording option as well the wifi is not working after security update. ok nice phone i purchased lenovo k8 note on 25-08-2017 salefirst of all thanks to amazon for quick delivery i recieved on 27 morningafter 5 days of use and testing my opinion about lenovo k8 note ispros1 dedicated sd card slot2 display and resolution approx 480ppi and corning gorilla glass protection3 no hanging issues and lag free4 stock android and google assistant and split screen mode5 camera:dual camera is ok depth enabling has to improve and front cam is best in this price with flash6 finger print scanner is so fast and accurate 95%7 ram management even 2 games and apps open simoltaneously working fine no problem detected8 dolby atoms even single speaker it gives decent soundcons1 even it is a deca core processor performs well and heats up as well up to 40 deg2 the sound from microphone is low while recording videos3 fast charger provided but it takes nearly 2 hr of time to charge and it gives 6 to 61/2 hr screen on time4 battery lasts for 1 day for heavy use and 1 1/2 days for normal use5 the charger sounds like keeeeeeee while charging and while charging device heats upoverall: it is a good phone we have to compromise on heating as it is mediatek processor it performs well and heats as wellif atleast they used snapdragon 625 the phone would be a game changeran update could fix camera and battery optimzation and heating my rating is 3.5/5 my phone is get heated from back side....so tell what should i do excellent phone audio problem , no multi tasking, bluetooth not matching with audio this lenovo phone is really awesome !unexpected things were :it has 2.5d curve screen and the display is quite big looks really good in reality .display is clear and shiny.the customized keypad..it has been customized systematically not so big not so small just perfect.it covers small portion of the screen.which is really sensible thing according to me .everything else is perfect. can\\'t buy this phone because many features not run properly .mobile hang problem. cast screen not work. basic applications not in-built killer device nothing to say battery problem nice buy.should buy and shouldn\\'t miss it not refunding option .this is wrost mobile after updating to android oreo this phone really sucks. pathetic battery life, heating and hanging. feel like throwing it on a wall only for battery issue .performance wise amazing 😍 charging takes lot of time and handset is very heavy compare to other handsets worst phone don\\'t buy itcamera is not working properlyit shows camera busy and black screen at times even flashlight not working sometimes..it gets fixed after reboot. great performance. but sound and display is not that much good. this hand set is not working well. bakwaas nice not so good as hyped while launching.... average processor ( keeps on hanging even after 4gb ram). battery rated for 4000mah but lasts for half a day only. phone heating is another issue. call recording missing.... original product , delivered on time and working very bad camera quality and camera depth feature not working properly , i have problem with battery charging it\\'s charging very very slow lenovo disappointed me pros-plenty of ramgood storage capacitydescent speakersturbo chargeamazing screen resolutiongood front camcons-turbo dischargeheavy weightheating issues sometimesback camera needs improvementtough to manage one handedstock android is not user friendly, like mi item is damaged no handfree with handset, i am a music lover so that deal was very costly for me. remaining is good..... because this phone is not volte support, only lte camera quality is great.. can click pics in hdr and also many options on focus etc... camera quality is good not super fantastic phone with all high quality specs. but phone is slightly heating but now every phone does it\\'s a pretty decent phone. the dual camera isn\\'t that great. discharge rate is faster. the screen is very fragile. i have dropped my mobile only once, that too not on the screen facing side. it broke into pieces. proper screen guards are also not available due to the screen curved design. a very good phone with ample storage and fast processor. my phone storage is now 50% full but it works just as fast! cameras at both ends are pretty good. depth in videos are well observed. brightness, lack of it, is a minor drawback. good i used this phone for only 11 days and suddenly battery drain and now phone is not butting on. may be software corrupted. completely dissatisfied with the phone. mobile has fallen down from half meter above and display broken.gorilla glass is not genuine. great performance. camera is excellent.but some things heating at charging time. otherwise awosame i love lenovo k8 note. the best product sell by amazon. 👍👍👍 it\\'s the jack of all trades but king of none. battery back up could have been better if they used some other processor. battery drains quite fast. camera is better than average. and i think there is no option to keep external media as your ringtone. only custom build ringtones available to set as your ringtone. kinda bums me out.update after 3 day use:battery back up is really horrible, normal usage like whatsapp and instagram browsing consumes more than 25% battery in an hour or so.then there is turbocharging issue, it starts with fast charging then after 10-20 minutes,depending upon mood, rate decreases, it took 7 hours to charge it by 40% in total.would really appreciate if amazon could take this matter seriously and take it up with lenovo and return the money of its customers for defective models. i personally would not trust my 14k bucks with lenovo or moto from this point on. ooosm phone... too much heat think before buying it? nice phone what is not in k8 note:-1) gallery2) battery percentage3) dolby isn\\'t up to the mark... ( as compare with lenovo k4 note)4) crop age option5) can\\'t set ringtone as u want...6) took 8 hours to full charge....except that it is best mobile of lenovo good product i am very dissatisfied due to it was not call voice recorder facility and sms not sending properly. finally this product is very burst mobile is good ,no heating but camera is very bad worst. very good ...i like this this phone.. hiting problem & no camera qaleti good product nice phone with killer features. the best in it\\'s budget 😘 lenovo is better then others and it\\'s amazing. great piece of equipment brought out by amazon. i liked the dual rear camera performance. i recommend this product with the price tag range. if anyone is thinking about this phone then bro/sis you are going for a very bad phone other companies are offering very good mobiles in this rangethere are not any specifics near description no turbo charger and battery quality is also very bad drains too fast brightness issue also and phone heats unexpectedly even in ideal conditioni think amazon is selling duplicate product or this mobile is worst awesome phone, great display, great features. loved it!!! 😍 nice look, worthful, handy.... best phone in this price.great pictures.great in built quality.it came in very good box.seller is very good nice phone amazing performance 1. serious heating issues on the back side.2. headphone slot is narrow. u have push headphone jack very hard. by doing so you might break your jack.3. not latching to the mobile network easily.4. lookwise just a regular slab phone.5. it\\'s heavy.not expected from a brand like lenovo.it\\'s not a killer phone. lenovo, you just killed the lenovo k8 note branding. all hype no performance.. truly disappointed by this phone. terrible camera, heavy, battery issue, hangs even though it\\'s stock android with 4 go ram... mobile is good ,camera results is super ..but battary backup is half day net connectivity and net speed is slowly .. not good phone....it heats very much every time camera is not good as expected according to dual camerawith depth camera there no flash optionoverall good phone.not excellent,😙😀😀😀😀😎😎😎😎 this is worst product. cam quality is not good. sound not good. worst screen. it is not gorella glass. simply got scratches. we don\\'t talk about battery. there is no words to explain about this worst battery. finally don\\'t buy this product. it\\'s a toy mobile with highly expensive cost. amazon battery to take these product back. if no, the reputation of amazon is fall down. (1)this phone have network problems probably secondary to sim card socket problem .(2) immediately battery drain.(3) here written returnable in 7 days , but once it delivered u can\\'t return to amazon or dealer. no doubt product is excellent in it\\'s price bracket. only one colour led light (white).... bt light not working for whatsapp messages... no such heating issues.... awesome game handling... nice phone heavy at first i was worried whether to buy this mobile or not because the reviews were very bad, but i still bought it. after using this mobile for three months i realised that all those reviews were not that true. i play heavy games easily on this mobile it does not hang at all. any device gets a little warm while working that doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s not working properly. the battery life is also good. there is no other mobile with so many features at so less price. i am really happy with it. 1. product received on time.2. the packing of the product was not up to the mark definite scope of improvement for amazon.3. product received in very good condition.4. phone working in good condition with no problem of hanging any time.5. satisfied with camera quality both rear and front.6. slightly on heavier side in weight and does get heated up .7. over all satisfied with the product. pros1. comes with a factory fitted silicon case2. ok interface for stock android.3. good looking phone4. dolby atmos is a good inclusioncons1. battery on single sim lasts 12-14hrs (for a power user). a dual sim would further reduce longevity.2. the much vaulted camera has a delayed shutter action.i used this phone after using a redmi 3s. the k8 pales in comparison in terms of key user parameters. plzz dont buy this phone if you are accepting that this phone battery will long last till a day thats not possible beacuse this phone battery drains very fast inspite of being a 4000mah battery ultimately this phone is worthless i had wasted my money plzz u dont dare to do the same this phone has heating problem too iam crying for my money know this is a dumb phone only battery draining fastly , otherwise it is an awesome smartphone at budget range good fone lenov k8 note and extent parfomus ear phone is missing from packet...so kindly look into this wonderful . it is true value of money. good product and i have a few questions about lenovo k8 note very

charge battery for 5mins after that my mobile heating temperature increases by 5° from 35 °to 40°..so they said only heating problems...they said they will refund amount..and returned my mobile back to them and i m waiting for my amount...it\\'s better we can buy mi a1. lenovo k8 note, i have received in nice packing and good quality transparent back cover. got best piece. product is performing satisfactory till now. if i would have purchased the same in this week, i could have got more rs. 1000 discount. any way good deal. worst phone lenovo k8 note. before i have purchased vivo v 5 is an excellent phone. best best phone ... good looking...good camera...osam sound..full hd display never buy this phone from amazon compromise with battery backup otherwise cool phone.gaming exp. smooth.camera is good disaplay good.turbo charger amazing.display is very nice worst phone ever don\\'t waste your money 2 camera are not working it\\'s a great product super this is very poor quality ph. but not compatible infront of k4 note battery life is going to end within 5 months. please avoid to purchase this mobile. useless phone. i never purchase hereafter in online , especially phones nice phone very gud phone.. wrost mobile value for the money no more explanation never go for this phone.it heats a lot. this hand set are thrdclass phone is very good, but worst battery performance overall experience is good but battery is draining faster like all former lenovo phones.sound is good.camera is average. it takes 2-2.5 hrs to fully charge the phone. back and front both camera\\'s isn\\'t not good quality. when i was try to zoom a picture it was broken. and also battery package is 5hrs only. this product isn\\'t worth of price. best phone ever leak nd heating problem not volte phone only lte mat layna es phone ko bakbas hay battery v nahi chalta hay the phone battert isn\\'t getting charged nd its getting drained early... battery issue was ryt from the start i am a music maniac.. i was using lenovo k5 note since one and half year and again i preferred lenovo( k8 note) this time only because of lenovo dolby atmos.. but the output of headset jack is really very very worst ....when compared to k5 note the volume output of k8 note is around 30% .....except this, lenovo k8 note is fine in all ways... the single star is for the performance of headphone jack... battery heat up drains faster fully charged take time 4 -5 hours, drains faster .amazon is not taking return of this product.cheaten by amazon for return value for money good average..not a special and best mobile on this range..sound is very low.. sim tray is not working properly battery drained fast. please replace my phone phone is not workingbattery is not charging even for 2hr0.2 last 4 day back i bought k8 note. but i am very upset it\\'s not working with my jio sim. mobile having heating problem also. i have put return request but they are saying they will not refund the amount only replacement can be placed. :( best mobile for students heating problem poor camera quality extremely dis-satisfied after the oreo update. is there a way to return the product ?? absolute waste of money i am still use this time i am not satisfied with this product,,,, the phone is simultaneously hanging,,, no apps working,,,, worst product,,,, excellent easy to access, good battery life. speakers volume could have been better. size is too small depth camera very bad cons:-- major issue with bluetooth connectivity. gets distorted all the time, very very bad.-- average camera (front and back both)-- never shows the full network range for mobile.got this phone on 12th oct but it had major bluetooth connectivity issue so placed a replacement on amazon and received the replacement unit on 24th oct which had even worse bluetooth connectivity issue than the first unit, finally requested amazon for a refund, wasted almost a month behind this useless device.pros :-- good phone build quality-- feels premium in hand-- can use dual sim along with memory cardbuy at your own risk and be ready to get a taste of amazon customer support which is very irritating and useless, no coordination between departments, i have already received my refund, but still getting calls from amazon cc for product pickup for refund purpose.finally, brought mia1 which is much better device than k8 note. build and camera quality is much much better than k8 note. nice fresh as lime....thnx... turbo charging has stopped after 5 days. it takes over 3 hours to charge the phone using the official lenovo charger. battery backup is hardly 17 hours on full charge and low usage. the lenovo user forum is full of complaints pertaining to battery backup of this phone. the troubleshooting steps suggested by lenovo technical support have not helped at all.other issues include low signal on 2nd sim ( irrespective of telecom provider), alarm not working when phone is switched off or on battery saver.the deca core processor is extremely powerful and the phone is blazing fast. just doesn\\'t hang or lag. however despite having a 4000 mah battery, the backup is appalling, making the phone completely unreliable. what is the point in having so much horsepower when there is no battery backup to power it. no wonder the phone was being sold at a steep discount.the reviews posted on amazon are not 100% factual or accurate.go through this link before you decide to buy the phone : https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/k8-xt1902-smartphones/hi-guys-is-there-any-solution-for-battery-drain-issue-in-lenovo/td-p/3777078 mobile is good but heating issue. sim network problem so many time not

price @10800.all features are good.phone is responding too fast.%camera is ok not very impressive.%only one major problem is heating while charging.%you cannot handle the phone while charging.%battery backup is also very good. good phone is good, work is so fast then other phone. but *amazon can deliver be late... * after updating to oreo i was not able to make video call very poor performance. this time am really disappointed by lenovo lenovo k8 is very heating phone hand and charging superb.... functioning very well..good rom & ram.camera clarity on 13 mp +5 mp is fantastic with flash and without flash.killer experience in selfie (13 mp) with party flash and nice.in time of online, network always full & ready at any moment.very fast finger -print sensor performance.i like it. after 4 days of usage really very disappointed with k8 note battery backup is hell it consumes more than 45% on standby mode battery won\\'t last for more than 3 hrs while light usage of cell phone think 10 times before you buy. finger print scanner is too poor over all phone very good but only one problem i\\'m facing heating. not only charging time any time i using phone is very hot. good performance in all departments but,camera performance is very poor. nice sturdy and good looking phone, though on the heavier side. phone is very responsive due to the 4gb ram and deca core processor. however, the battery back up is not amazing and the phone gets warm at times after using it for 30-40 minutes. camera- 9/10gaming- 10/10graphics- 10/10ram management- 8/10performence- 10/10heating- 9/10 best phone in this price segment. performance is great and battery life is awesome. it\\'s very very heating issue and battery backup is very very bad 2 - 4 hours only if data will be used simply waste of money i did not satisfied . for the price it matches the top brands.very good battery life, pictures taken are stunning. ota upgraded to oreo, works flawless.apps run smoothly.would have given 5 star,the only issue is the double tap to open is little unresponsive. please do not go for this mobile, i bought from amazon, in 3 months phone started showing issue with mic , and screen started showing yellow patches , went to services center of lenovo with issue, you can\\'t believe there are more than 10 cases of lenovo k8 for repair that day .most of people concerned about all major issue are in warranty,what happen after warranty. back to my issue, these service centreguys claims screen is not under warranty and you need to 5.5k to get repair of screen based on same your warranty will be re instead and then these guys will solve mic issue in warranty. for same discuss i lost 2 days, and these services are pathetically hopeless.hope this will help, please don\\'t go for lenovo phone\\'s not worth it. nice phone best mobile in this price range. all features are good & the glass of the mobile is superb #unbreakable... price worth it dont hestitate while buying✌️ best phone at this price range.it\\'s fast charging is very helpfull.i was beware of cheating on online purchase.but it is very safe in amazon value for money worse product. battery is durable awesome product. liked a lot. value for money i was expecting more than k4note. but many features are missing like voice recording, screen shot, screen off when phone face down, contracts in phone memory, alphabet at side of contact list, disappointed with my purchase. good camera quality. good sound although it doesn\\'t have a gallery. photos directly stored in google photos have good feature but sometimes it makes some problem..... loved this device. fast charging, good processor speed, dolby sound is awesome, screen clarity is fabulous.looking into the specifications, somewhere camera quality is compromised. no headphone with set is really a pain. good it’s okay.... overall the phone is good. but there is a issue with the volte on jio as if the phone is kept idle for 10mins then you ll keep on missing calls as the other party ll get that your sim is either switched off or not reachable. this is a big flaw if the phone is volte enabled. as one can\\'t continuosly keep on using the phone just to receive a call.a software update is required in this regards. just purchased the product and feature and working good. batary back up comes only one day if you are not browsing much. otherwise everything else looks good. primary camera resolution not so high. but it\\'s ok. this product is not good because many problems in this...1st of calling problem 2nd of internet problem .3rd of music sound problem..4th of 4g net connectivity start than call not now...so my suggestion is this product not purchased... good product very bad experience cost is higher than expected. nobody should buy a item at the launching time. issues faced from the day of purchase itself!1. flickering of brightness light2. dead pixel (white) on screen3. no in-build gallery4. heating while running application5. even the battery is 4100 mah drains out quite quickly not as expected6. while running application phone sometimes hangs7. a very bad experience while receiving the phone that is no delivery, late delivery and defective product received by this particular seller.8. as features mentioned on social media about the phone are very good but according to my experience it\\'s not up to the mark. so guys think twice before you make a purchase and make sure read all reviews from other customers too it\\'s just my personal opinion amazing phone with great ram..camera quality also good... not good as i was expecting.. front camera is a bit blurry.. only the sound quality is gud product is good but sound clarity is very low..not able to here sound while calling to someone worst phone.. hanging at an starting stage don\\'t buy lenovo company itself awesome good mobile touch screen super phone features are good but facing few problems like , heating, battery gets exhausted v.fast and major problem is phone gets blink often. never buy this mobile. serious heating problem. nice product. feature rich. pretty fast because of decacore processor. camera quality is acceptable but not as good as mi phones. build is good. volte op. is fine. bundled back cover is slippery. please change this handsetsbecouse of mobile hang issues in charging heating problem.display light low down.battery drain automaically... it\\'s just awesome ❤️❤️ nice mobile mind blowing. i like very much phone not working, hanging,camera issues, heating like hell,cant open any app .. after the updates problem increases , just received phone 2-3 days back , seriously dont buy it ... the worst part is not charging .. in last 4 hrs only 5% battery charged .... it increased the bezel size while others reduce it. lack of uni-body design. battery backup is not good turbo charger doesnt work sometime and 2 time replaced then too same prblm i was purchased lenovo n8 before 1.5 month. but within 1.5 month the speaker of my phone not working. worst phone. don\\'t buy. amazon is totally 3rd class. awesome mobile battery back up is wrost..all other fesilite is wpr not good as expected. heating too much and i faced charging issue after software update. might be conflict between hardware and updates which clearly shows incompatible hardware. you get only 1 day battery backup and you have to keep battery saver mode on if you\\'re not using else it drains super fast. being lenovo k4 note owner i had much expectations with k8 note though it didn\\'t meet any of my expectation. the picture depth & clarity of the photos is average very poor phonenever to buy this productbattery is not working properly at alldrains 2 to 3 times in a day gr8 product ..nice camera nice one all over good but sometimes phone very heat and charging not supported phone is very beautiful but charging in phone is over hot super nice product, 1 day battery backup with wifi and internet. camera not up to the mark. no lagging, hanging don\\'t buy this worst experience just a average phone... not like best...but battery backup is very poor.. i don\\'t like this mobile super phone nice camera,no hanging,super dolby sound..... awesome performance at this price range super no casting i had use this device hardly for 10 to 11days & my device motherboard not working i want replacement for my device performance of the phone is good . nice mobile very good performance nice phone really all functions are killer don\\'t buy the phone it\\'s very annoying and disappointing..poor battery performance.. good good product good sound....finger print nice...nice camera...bt battery is a total disaster...drains by evening 5 after a full night charging and why the hell is it 4000mah....and d phone gets heated up much more than my previous asus zenfone2...can\\'t keep it in my pockets when it gets heated....disappointed with d phone very worth product i have ever seen.. 1st 2 days is good.. but then its problem with battery drainage.. for mobile standby. then its not charging fast.. it takes 5 hr for full charge..when i clicking photo then open file manager but i can\\'t show the recent photos.. then i format my phone.. but the new problem is my camera is gain more light frome source.. and picture fully hazy.. best phone by lenovo ,the dual camera with depth mode really capture images like dslr one ,and its design is perfect ,turbocharging in this lenovo phone is great feature,and i am fan of lenovo note series.🤘 not a satisfactory headset. problem faced are as below:-1. hanging problem2. very slow processing3. low battery backup (up 7 hrs only)4. much time taken for battery charge (up to 06 hrs from 10 to 100 %) basic phone and basic software very good phone phone is good except that battery drains a little fast and has heating issue at the top on back side(not like boiling but you can feel the heat in 15 mins of game-play or when using internet). camera is decent. comes with a transparent case (which is not that good) and a fast charger. worst mobile there was used mobile also awesome phone after use 2wk i feel following drawbackphone has network issue,poor camera , battery drain quickly,no fast charging effect ,wifi hot spot not work properly. very slow.....msg & call (basic application) is not working properly........instead use nokia..... i want douplicate bill ....how i get it...? battery back up is not as per mark .. phone also hangs while calling . it also deletes contacts from phone book when put on charging and automatically opens other functions . camera quality is not excellent yet to evaluate but i find headset missing . waste of money worst product was using lenovo k4 note for 3 years high expectations with this model but this phone sucks !!!!! charger is making hisss noise. although it is not getting hot. very poor battery... m too much unhappyit takes more dan 8hrs to charge from 5 to 100%and ones u use da internet da charge becomes 0 in just 4 hrs... it\\'s like always connecting ur phone to charger more than using it....and also da heating trouble... it\\'s the best phone in this price range performance, design, battery and turbo charging is ok but camera quality and display clarity is not as per expectation. not give at list 1 star...i m using handset from last 6 month and there is bigger and bigger heating prob ...valueless mobile phone cancelled order before delivery. the reviews are very bad for oreo update. the phone becomes unusable and mother board is also affected by the update. frequent restarts is the most common problem faced by users. good phone. lenovo k8 note has severe issues like 1. the in-bound and out-bound voice calls are not working while the phone is kept idle for 1 hr or more. 2. jio video call is not working. 3. the mobile hangs when the camera options are changed. 4. the carrier signals showing weak though the other phones like lenovo k5 note shows good strength. 5. call recording option is not available. 6. call management for blacklist is not easy. 7. the mobile is becoming warm while charging. 8. sometimes the mobile hangs .. it requires restart superb very good and useful mobile i received lenovo k8 note on 28.08.2017. it is getting very hot while charging. it takes 3 to 4 hours to get charged with turbo charger. battery gets drained very soon and do not stay even for one day. return item menu also not working. both rear and front camera too poor.i preferred it over redmi note4 just for it\\'s camera specs but picture quality is way below for a 13+5mp dual can. images gets blur even at slight zoom in really a good phonegood battery lifegood processorgood cameraeverything is goodwants to improve in camera side not as expected the phone boasts a lot but is a let down. i took it with a lot of expectations cuz this phone basically combines the best of both worlds the redmi note 4 and moto g5s plus and more. it\\'s a jack of all trades and a master of none (except maybe music ). the battery drains during standby and moderate gaming for like ten minutes causes it to heat up.it has dolby atmos sound enhancement and a dedicated music key which is a unique feature. people who like music, might appreciate it. the fact that the sim slot is not hybrid is another plus point. not so good as expected.battery backup is poor .not worth to buy @13999 rs.it\\'s a not a true smart phone,it\\'s poor in functions,there r so many cons with this phone.dont buy pls.can amazon or seller ll buy back.i don\\'t want this phone. fabulous smartphone ever mobile battery damage & mobile battery dry condition mobile refud the mobile lenovo k8 note has charging problemit takes 5 to 6 hours for full charging and battery drains

performing product. anticipate lenovo please will disappointed you. not at all user friendly. different to even delete call history or edit profile verry good i am a regular customer of amazon as well as lenovo mobiles. all my previous lenovo mobiles were fine without any problem but this mobile is a disppointment because audio is very poor in the sense i am virtually unable to hear other people speak to me eventhough i have kept the call volume at the maximum. never ever thought that lenovo and amazon would ditch me like this. i cant go in for a replacement also as i threw away the original packing and the invoice as i was confident that this mobile also will be as good as my earlier lenovo mobiles. good mobile good one i had received this cell-phone on 7th august. look wise the phone is an average view. main things phone has came with the turbo charger but actually it takes minimum three to four hours for fully charged the phone. battery comes with the 4000 mah power but its hardly go with a day or upto evening. i am also facing with the phone hitting issue . so, i am not satisfied with the phone and in fact i am going to back this phone.-thank you exclusive it\\'s really good to have a great mobile.quality, performance, look, ... all good**** * *** good.... good phone getting hot during charging,camera image poor.doesnt capture bindis in forehead, cast is not

product.a) good battery backupb) optimised performance along with 4 gb ram and octacore processorc) dolby atmos speakerd) overall a worthy phonee) awesome camerahighly recommended to all who are comparing with xi red mi note 5 pro of course the phone having 4000mah battery but it drains like the 2kmah batterydoesn\\'t even last a full day long with 4g on..the worst thing is the stock android osthere are lots of bugs in os softwarecast screen doesn\\'t even workcontacted lenovothey saying it can\\'t be resolvedhighly disappointed while charging mobile going to be warm good camera is good, not satisfied with battery and screen cast, no additional features like k4. not good work almost fine but there is some software issue most app crashesh normally : depth mode camera is not so god nice product.. value for money . wonderful very good mobile. battery was drained very quickly..within 10 minutes it 4% was drained and verified by the amazon technician... nice product from lenovo.everythings good, shall share the bads - heating issue is there with phone, gets slow on extensive usage, doesn\\'t feel like working on 4gb ram machine, good for soft use. jio sim working with very poor signal both data & voice quality is worst . i think this is not a 4g cellphone and it is any how converted from other phones. purchasing is wastage of money i purchased this phone in dec 2017. missing the dual apps feature which is a must. very good mobile set even low cost, not comparable any other mobile with this cost. everything is more than average. it is a all rounder phone. but music output is too artificial. the natural sound is totally absent. there is a trend going on nowadays and even people are liking these artificial sound outputs(dolby atmos). nice....⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ good budget stock android phone,strong battery , turbo charging is very good feature, cool camera experience, dolby sound is amazing... i am happy with this! sent bill nice very good everything is good except all contacts are getting saved on web accounts only. there\\'s no option to save new contacts to phone memory. battery back up is excellent. shall provide updates on software including such added basic features. its music is not good as lenovo vibe k5only one issue received two piece of soap inside the mobile box....shameful. rating is compulsory!? i like the display and working of lenovo k8 note. but to my surprise started receiving problem from day one.cons :wi-fi problem. repeatedly disconnects and connects again.signal fluctuation in both sim. using internet is a bit time problemat times body heats which makes using mobile impossibleif you buy through amazon it will be a much more tougher task to get the mobile replaced or refund. no proper responce after multiple complaints.no headset in boxpros:good sounddisplay is much better than other phones in this price rangebattery backup is goodbody finishing is betteroverall good phone if there is no network issue. i strongly suggest not to buy it through amazon or anyother marketplace. visit physical store so that you can check the phone at the time of buying. very bad. received used product it\\'s good but not able to make call recording very nice product but my invoice is not coming in mail very much satisfy with ke novo k8 note .no problem at all. all good about display, battery, looks etc. don\\'t know why i bought this smartphone... i always stick with the sd processor but the way lenovo was branding it got me attracted.sold just after 4 day use.... battery draining was like insane... 3-4 hours of standby also recharge problem...and one thing it heat like an iron by god it was a fault to buy never ever i\\'ll be buying any mediatek processor smartphone....#worstpurchaseever awesome phone with long battery life and good camera quality. turbo charger really charges fast and as i\\'m a moderate phone user my phone\\'s battery lasts almost whole day. i charge it only once a day and sometimes even after 24 hrs pros & cons explained.                   1. very good, sleek design and elegant look, just alike iphone 7 plus.2. very fast, storage is abundant with sd card support is a plus.3. sim and sd card slots are seperate.4. very smooth to touch and android nougat rocks!cons:1. battery runs up drained too fast when connected via 4g lte or wifi.2. volume is very low than you can really imagine, when played via earplugs / wired headsets / bluetooth headset or speakers.3. no inbuilt gallery app or a music player, so poweramp supports well, when purchased at $1.rest all are great, including the delivery, which is very fast. nice mobile.price worth of it. getting over heated with a little use cool earphone not in box. please provide this item.awesome mobile battery drains so quickly.issue with edge detection when you are in depth mode. depth mode /dual camera is useless as its unable to detect edgesheating issue a little bit.otherwise the phone is fine. cast screen not working.for smart tv screen mirroring purpose . charger stopped working after 2 months nice and really killer phone. not a great deal...only camra is better.getting slow while playing game.far battery backup.mi note 4 is better.i want my money back..... its battery power is very meek and dosesnt work more than 3 hours alsoo.. i was cheated here.. need to return it.. using this phone since oct 13 2017... excellent experience.. i love this mobile till now.. battery backup good.. dolby atmos.is not that much excellent in this mobile... camera quality sooper... i would suggest average middle class budget mobile buy ers to buy this one... like me excellent mobile. i have received the defective product and the device is not powering on. worst experience with amazon good not recommend.. tooo heavy.. tooo heat... too slow... and other issues.. poor camera quality and hiting issue. please don\\'t buy this phone. is it volte? earphone is mentioned in the leaflet but not provided with mobile..... here i will attached copy of leaflet camera and battery is not good battery like 2000 mah battery stand only 8 hrs initially it was working properly ..but after a month there is display problem .. moving waves appears on the display which i don\\'t like battery is not up to the mark. head phone also not provided, mobile getting heat while in use. good featureszijn the mobile has heating issues. while on call the mobile heats up. lenovo k8 note is a very bad product from lenovo, because videos are not playing and mp3 are not playing and ringtones are not setting up...if i know that i\\'m not buying this lenovo k8 note.its very bad, bad, bad, wrost product.........i loss my money never buy this product- signal quality is poor, cast option does not work, bluetooth connectivity is poor sound breaks in-between, does not have option to edit pictures, video streaming is poor or takes times to start video. there dialing page is not user friendly, frequent dialed number are displayed in large size hence leading to unnecessary calling on frequent dialed. camera quality is very poor and pixels break on initial zoom only. moreover flash light nothing worst then that. overall a bad choice in same price you can find much better device meeting your expectations. bauth hi bekar phone this is one of the worsed mobile phones i have ever used in my life ...... it is getting so hot while talking ... best mobile but battery not good i fell for the spectacular specs of k4 note when it was launched... it died out on me just after finishing the warranty period...horrible support team and ridiculously expensive repair... so i ditched it loosing some data also along with it..and then i did it again, i fell for fake glitters when the k8 note was launched, despite all the friendly warnings... hardly a month in its already starting to taste bitter…casting doesn\\'t workrestarts all too often at its own willa dual camera that is a jokemany apps hangs often despite the jaw dropping specs (deca core my foot)verdict: lenovo is not dependable very good deal & value for money. working smooth even in 3gb ram. only reason for not giving 5 star bcoz it is not coming with earphone not supported to volte , camera is not good and voice call clarity low. pros:best design 2.5d curved glass like nokia 6cameras are excellent except in dual modeno lagmain thing is the dolby atmosbest surround effect and if you are music lover then go for itcons:bad battery backupit\\'s 3000mahnot overheating but while charging get heated up cerema quality is so poor... superb phone worth for buying... everything good.. packing to bad.. no safety for transit.... camera resolution is not as per expected.it blurr too much.also turbo charger sucks.it takes 2:10 min to complete charge battery.too slow. its performance is very bad,battery took 4 to 5 hours time to full charge and discharge took same time.camera is ok but no special options available for editing like as sony. for this product cost is too high not reasonable (8k is suffiecient). no earphones packed hence my suggestion is dont purchase this phone. excellent performance using it for 1 month now. feeling like a mistake..very bad experience.heating even when idle.charger stop working.automatically discharge from 60 to 0 overnight.no phone support.worst service center.(even hard to find) very bad burning like a heatervery very bad koi mat fasna the phone came with lots of bugs. the dolby atoms sound system of the phone did not work properly and need to restart the phone again and again. moreover i didn’t get any refund from amazon and needed to sell it by myself. hang problem it\\'s d the worst phone i have used ever. not as good as i was expecting worst phone ever by lenovoheating issu, ram management issue worst dual camera very good one with nice features within an acceptable price.........very good one all are excellent at this price range but want to improve battery life compare other 4000mah smartphones just loved it. mobile is good but it is not connect with computer during hotspot. do not buy this model. i bought it on 16 oct . it had a problem of slow charging though it\\'s supposed to be turbo charging. they replaced my phone. i have used this replacement phone for last 25 days, now it has display problems. lines appear on the display. not sure how this problem will be addressed. fantastic phone in every aspect. gets charged very quickly. amazing sound quality for high quality movies. it has dolby atmos sound. if you enable dolby and watch movies with dolby sound you will get real theatric effect on this little phone with headphones on. real value for money. i am really surprised by the sound quality. it\\'s an excellent piece of art based on performance and battery... but 15w turbo charger is not the right name for it\\'s charger because it takes around 150mins to nearly 3 hours sometimes to charge the mobile after updating heating phone the screen is so fragile , despite the corning gorilla glass claim , the screen broke after a small fall . i have used phones that didnt have corning gorilla glass that sustained bigger falls .the price tag really explains a lot . cheap quality stuff with high specs . buy at your own risk very bad no fast charging... took 2 hours to charge from 50-100... i am shocked seeing this phone specifications and price. camera quality very killer. phone overall performance is killer. friends buy this smartphone. not a good phone a huge problem in all lenovo k8 note phone both speakers are not working properly.please give me suggestion what can i do ? my phone got hanged when i switch it on.it remains stucked for almost 15 minutes fantastic phone really killer features.very nice camera. do not buy this phone. it\\'s better to buy mi or a local chinese phone rather than buying lenovo. this product overheats so much that you will not be able to hold it. if you continue talking to someone via call for over 30 minutes, the device will get so hot that it can burst in any point of time. its been only 6 months now that i am using this and i am facing such problems. even when the charger is connected the battery continues to discharge. have got it checked from the service center but the issue is still not resolved. pathetic fone k cast screen will not work camara quality is poor.battery also poor quality not performing as advertised worst one over heating low battery bck up good kind attn... don\\'t buy this phone ....even camera too bad....over head....on 15 days lenovo service centre is saying software issues on new phone....i last my money ... amazon sells all defective phone of lenovo.... pls choice better phones no lenovo k 8 note. super amazing product from lenovo, i was really impressed for the price tag they have offered. no complaints about this dabba phone good good processing power, good charging speed but worst battery backup excellent good

not working, average battery life, average cameras, good display and good performance apart from phone heating up and slow delivery time.. the phone screen was having a dark shade at the bottom this phone has awesome features with a decent look..the only problem i am facing is not getting a perfect tempered glass as the screen is curved from it\\'s edges. value for money. it little bit heat while

phone.poor camera quality poor battery backup. phone lekar phas gya........... not able to return also...... good product ! call recorder is not available when used other call recorder app i heard only my own voice. worst mobile, my lenovo vibe k5 is better than this device, gorilla glass screen has broken, it has less feature than vibe k5 note. i want te return it pls let me know if i could return it, i bought it on lanch. also it has network issue, only 1.5 gb ram available for user, it is unable to open facebook lite . i am happy with the product and it is doing great and i m using it till last few months cool & sexy phone overall good phone its working is slow and hang over many times during use . everything is very good ultimate mobile ... good camera ... good battery backup. hello,the phone starts resetting itself randomly. this issue starts after after 3 days of use, especially when you use it for longer time like watching a you tube video for an hour or two. the issue starts to repeat after 1 or 2 days, then i tried few option mentioned in lenovo help app which is pre-installed(i am feeling like a stupid for having done this) , after that for 4 or 5 days it didn\\'t show this issue. now it back with a bang and almost resets itself every night. use the phone in night, then lock it and keep aside and when you take the phone again in the morning, boom, it is dead already. and when you manually power-on there is enough juice left in the battery. not sure what to do with this kind of issue, the phone is absolutely useless.when i approached amazon for return, they are quoting policy and suggest me that i should run pillar to post to get problem rectified (not sure even it is rectifiable issue), the below amazon\\'s tagline tag-line sounds funny\" earth\\'s most customer-centric company.\", i am not really sure whether they understood what they really mean, i am already started feeling bitter for my purchase decision in amazon and now i realized that buying lenovo brand is same as throwing your money into garbage. so bad experience this product good ...... i\\'m using lenovo k8 note from 1 monthi\\'m suffering from battery problemnow the battery is not goodit works only for 15 % - 1 hr nowit mean only 6 hrs no heating...good product return good one so far so good only concern the phone got heated some time while talking ..... after the oreo update, the phone is restarting after every 15 minutes i have purchased lenovo k8 note... a very good smartphone bad camera quality,normal phone upgradable mobile received phone today, phone gets heated too fast. performance is worst. it is supposed to be simple looking phone but processing and working is much better. it is soft to move your fingers around to open apps.picture quality is good but not excellent deca core processor is awesome. best part is u can use dual sim and also u can have a sd card. performance is awesome. battery for normal usage easily you can get it for 2 days . fast charge is great.camera is decent not as good as they are claiming. slightly hearing on heavy usage. small amount good fone all function super... awesome..my wife birthday gifted.. lenovo k8 note..mind blowing👌👌👌👌👌by amazon nice mobile after phone goes into sleep, it stops workingwhoever calls you will get message that your phone is switched off am using this phone for last 2 month till now no problems faced with moderate gaming,internet use and camera use and moderate calling over lte battery stay for full day. nice phone for a user like me battery heats up while playing simple games. nice phone but heating issue little bit too much bad products. after 2-3 monhhs battery backup goes to low and dolby doesn\\'t work perfect. nice phone. sry the product is nt good the charger is nt good the charger don\\'t charge the phone proper only if mobile is switched off not so good. when i put in charging the mobile get hit. not happy with the product. i want to return it and i want my money back as soon as possible bad performance waste money thanks to the lenovo again for making this type of product. it\\'s body material is too good for rough and tough working person pro:13+5mp back cam,13 front nice nd decent cam performance. .no lags and excellent performance...battery good and turbo charge awesome...main thing heating issue i afraid before buy dis product, but still no heating issue...sound quality is very good like moto. .stock android i feel like moto phones...levono k8 phone is like moto experience. . .cons,headphones not provide... camera is not up to mark in lowlight and once u get tis device it can\\'t be return or replaced, battery is also not that grt whn compare to note 4, earphone sound is not even like basic phones its very very worst, delivery and packing by amazon is also very worst nice mobilecamera is goodworth for money picture quality is not impressive. heating problem. headphones missing, that\\'s why rs 1000 less charged so a cheap marketing gimmick by lenovo. otherwise good phone with advanced features but k6 power is superior to this. worst phone. i have used so many lenovo product but this one is worst. i have used lenovo k3 note, k5 note so i purchased k8 note. but this phone is worthless. no feature. no functionality. company is cheating. no casting option, no ots support. delivery on time, phone is also good

10 days, all r good working i didn\\'t found any type of issue. but charging time then getting heatup because reason is that 15 wat terbo quick charging. quick battery drain because 2.3 ghz havey processers, but lenovo must be working about music player or battery saver software for next updation....... battery performance is poor.. otherwise it is best.. nice in this price range and all things are possible so nicely thanks bad product hanging and heat not stable bettery good phone as i expected camera is of poor quality ,don\\'t go for this device jahnu shukla no headphones in the box.camera not as expected.cant change the ringtone,we have to use system provided ones only.data gets closed when we get calls.lenovo killer note 8...killed my all expectations,not satisfied with this phone. only one rear camera is working and both sim slot have network issue.please don\\'t buy this phone it has many problem. very good phone with their performance. while specs are good on papers, not in real life and lot of bugs are there. k5 note was hit in its range, but not k8 note. quality product just bought the phone and when i inserted the jack of the headset,it won\\'t go in!

is switched off.no call record option.daily data used cannot be seen.all these features are present on much less priced redmi phones.very much disappointed.will never recommend others to buy. nice performance 4g ram super fast i brought this mob after using coolpad cool (glass broken). i expexted a lot on chnaging to a bigger brand name of lenovo. but the phone is not performed as expected.i liked to compare cool pad cool with k8 notepros.better look. nice to holdcomparing to coolpad cool, thats allconsno direct wifi casting to tv, you need chrome cast to cast or screen sharing. this was totally disappointing.bluetooth connection in car is not so smooth. but the connection from coolpad cool was just superb.depth sensor of rear camera is not that good comparong to coolpad cool.i am writing this because if someone said this previously i will never buy this phone.update after using 2 months*bluetooth connection has some serious problem.*not customizable like coolpad*camera is below average*cannot use finger print sensor selfie clicksi dont recommend this phone bettery performance is very low it can\\'t stand a single day with using your phone charging period is very long ...approx 5-6 hrs take for full charge ....pls advice that how many take time for full charge good phone good product. value for money. nice interface. smooth working. worst phone ever. worst camera,tried amazon help, customer care help from lenovo.. nothing worked..bokeh mode not working at all.camera z pathetic.mybworst buy from amazon. phone is very heating and camera is ok not a good phone it\\'s average phone looks ok works fine but supplied cable doesn\\'t work and amazon as usual is unable to refund or replace it. expect such problems with chinese product as amazon does not verify it.don\\'t buy. nice touch response rare camera is awsm but front camera is dull.. even not better than redmi note 4... sound quality is also not enough to satisfaction ... redmi note 4 has thousand time better sound quality.. overall i don\\'t recommend on this price range.. worst phone ever seen. i would suggest everyone don\\'t ever purchase any lenovo phones. u may get attracted by it\\'s price and features, but they are just for name sake and not worth at all. it has various issues but the top ones being extreme heating and battery draining. it\\'s been just 6 months i have purchased this phone and now it\\'s fingerprint sensor is also not working as good as it was initially, network connectivity issue, extreme heating, battery draining especially after it\\'s recent software update to oreo. a complete waste of money. very less brightness, no light on below key touch and no ear phones with product so then wat purpose for dolby atmos paying 13999. not much worth. no otg . so fast device superb phne i have received the product within daysbut phone is not upto the mark# battery very poor only one day staying the charging (4000mah)# camera also no so good,# there is no option of call recording# call logs also not removable / delete u must be delete all call logs not single..!!!over all its bad experiance superb features and hd display internet experienced me a

not responding when it lock phone is good review after one month usecamera quality is good double camera also working but it\\'s compromised but overall camera qualityscreen quality is good but brightness is very poor it\\'s very dispointing but full hd screen good onebattery life good it can survive full day if you r not using gaming or camera like heavy work for long timeprocessing is pretty fast theirs not overall hanging problem but when you start installing heavy apps then some time apps giving errors and fon is little hanging but running smoothlywater resistant is plus point it\\'s splash proof so some water doesn\\'t effectphone is useable if you think you can buy it worth money good mobile but screen is not scratch resistant on the day when my phone arrived at noon then after 2-3 hrs i found scratches on my screen but overall it is a good mobile this lenovo k8 is no gorilaglass the amazon is chitting not my mobile glass was broken so amazon is very very very bad . friends camera best good phone for this budget.dual camera features could be better. excellent phone. great phone,super fast,great camera,great sound quality,64 is sufficient space heating problem. i will return it... insurance is not accept good but 2 what\\'s up aap not running using the phone from last one month or so and all features are working as described. pros1. good battery life2. great touch...cons1. dual camera not so good.. bokeh effect is not at the expected levels.2. design is quite similar to other smartphones... everything is well except speakers goes off randomly and after knocking the phone starts and works well it happened three times this week very good phone the battery gets heated up while charging and gets drained by evening when on in full 4g net connection. the cameras doesnt have depth in shot and clarity is missing not good nice phone but my mobile touch is broken worst product suggest to never buy my jio network disconnected after using is for 5 days i try everything to fix this out nothing happen..please help me nice phone in this price... i have gone through certain reviews on amazon. smooth operating and awesome to operate. if u r expecting quality of iphone in this price that will not happen. but by considering cost benefit ratio it\\'s worth of its identical. little issue of heating for continuous operation but u are not operating it as 24×7. good product and good battery life its an ok ok phone in this price range .build quality of phone is good with a metallic back .battery of the phone is not dat long lasting dat is expected with a 4 k mah one.the frint camera and flash is very nice but when u will come to back camera which is the main high light of the phone , then u will be disappointed as ghe depth doesnot work.fingerprint is fast and good..phone also heat up sometimesabruptly and usually during charging although during running instagra. some times the phone lags othe than its decent in gaming . i will suggest mi.a1 rather than this .rest it depends upon u . the phone also consumes data more that that of mi. very good p good as expected camera quality is poor and this phone bit slow also i am writing this review after using of one month.phone is of good quality.bty back up is well.camera quality is also well.screen with gorilla glass is also well.i suggest to buy this product because in this range of cost is good phone.i bought it at deewali offer in cost 11999. very bad experience. handset looks good. but mobile is getting heat and battery backup is very bad. his charger is very slow but phone runs very good and performance is also very good excellent display and screen is very big while seeing in front.i will suggest for good buying. not good stock android not user friendly like earlier versions of lenovo with vibe ui.performance is good.heating problem in less and camera quality is awesome. is product defective....... excellent mobile. performance wise, it is worth of the cost. however is low on quite few details.very vulnerable to accidental falls or pressure. screen and camera glass are too cracky. mine got few cracks and i could not even understand how it happened. to state i keep the phone with utmost care with back cover and screen guard.this lacks inbuilt contact saver.it saves in your email account.lacks feature to personalise ringtone till you download ringtone cutter and make the ringtone.transfer of files are tough. personalisation of various options is not convenient. ram usage remains always high for very basic usage with fb,gmail,whatsapp applications only.adding to the above the cons as below after about 2 months usage.1.gets hung up frequently.2.applications including gui gets hung.3.finger print detection lags.4.no inbuilt contact memory. it always saves stuff in email account.5.screen is not tough at all. not upto the mark of gorrilla glass as specified.6. files do not get arranged properly. camera was not good worst phone it takes more than 4 hrs to charge.there is network problem.it directly on my phone data.within two days it shows 4-5 times update.battery draining very fast worst phone, misleading specifications.battery with normal usage will last for a half day.camera quality is not great,those two cameras st rear are eye wash.network issueheating up very poor performance, network issues,game install the mobile.. mobile is heat... ok ok phone good mobile its kind of jack of all trade. and the processor is very good in it. one of the best in this price. camera is not good good mobile i hate lenovo k 8 note because battery problem, phone is good. but amazon delivery is very bad bill copy nice phone at it\\'s pricegood product worst ever. battery drains in half hour. phone hangs and software problem. slow to operate. worst. worst product ever i return it.. this is an amazing phone it is good for the pricethe camera quality was at best expecially the depth sensor was very good performance and the slow motion was excellent good to have it facing severe issues with the phone and now stuck on how to get this returned... pl help. the battery gets drained within few hours and there is something wrong.. facing hanging issues as well nice looking, impressive tocuh and ui. but camera average it is a good smart phone... i received mobile and i did not received headset in the box how it\\'s missing headset and seal was check but how in seal box pic how headset missing i want to review awesome phone how can i cover warranty phone showing problem good. all round good product.but at this price you will get better phones.dual camera is not so great. software modifications needed to take advantage of dual cameras.buy mi a1 or lenovo p2 with few extrac bucks instead of this . i would recommend to skip this phone and wait for new phones or go with a little higher (1k to 2k) phones. as there are many features missing in this .ex: quick ball is missing , one hand mode is missing ..let me know if anyone wants to know any more information regarding the phone . my mobile camera is giving blur photo i have done many setting feeling so bad . it\\'s such great mobile to use. no update availlable,camera quality is poor.battery backup is also not up to mark.comparing with other phones with same buget,this is the most worst product👎👎👎👎👎 awesome handset . .loved it .camera is fantastic . nice phone in this price range.. but screen sharing doesn\\'t work on anycast or miracast.. so 1 less star. hello \"amazon\" are you selling chocolates or mobiles.worst mobile.after using for 10 minutes dolby atoms stopped working. battery is poor 1. heating problem at the charging time2. battery backup is low.3. all function is ok. very poor mobile chargeing complaint bad in.performance i love this phone. very good quality phone. speaker louder. betry backup owsm.i am disappoint in price i bought in 14000 now 12000 .. wat rubbish.. i am not happy as its heating unable set ringtone as well as night time pics are not good heating issues it\\'s good phone there was no ear phone . this is a useless phone i bought it for 13000 but they told me that this phone will never loose connections or signals and it is connected and its switching off continuously and when i say hello it hears as hay camera quality is very poor, look like very heavy gadget.. people comparing it with 15k phones and its true that it does not compete with them but according to its price its a good phone. very good mobile phonelenovo k8 not volte not support goog very bad experience with lenovo... battery is very bad... charging from 0% to 100% takes almost upto 7 hours perhaps it has turbo charging enabled and battery draining so quickly (losses 20% charge in 4-5 hours) ,ie standby battery timing is not upto mark... very bad experience... phone is also lagging even it has been only 2 weeks of using... want help from amazon.... plzz support bad dual camera, no backlight on home & back keys, heating issues, battery drains fast & not enough as per specifications, totally dissappointed not working as i thought.....not happy with the performance of the set. battery is pathetic, it\\'s drain so fast while using mobile data. rear dual camera is very bad, if ur using a single camera its good. but the dual camera and bokeh effect is very very bad. while connecting to bluetooth speaker i hear broken sound, i don\\'t what\\'s going wrong while connecting to bluetooth speaker. previous device i used was redmi note 4, has got a awesome battery backup and it\\'s ui was great. dont go for this mobile ....gorilla glass is very weak and waste of money for buying this mobile... 18 sep 2017 ki sham 5.30bje phone receive hua aur aj 19 sep 2017 ko phone band ho gaya... on hi nahi ho raha... i want to return this phone...9450283097 best phone avoid buying this product.battery give performance like 2000 mah.bigger thanks to amazon for take return this product.and give refund in only 6 hours in account. it\\'s same like k5 note only one thing was changed dual camera only i am not update phone, because of in reviews so many worte heat when update the phone, in is not dual standby 4g, working ok. not as expected lenovo k8 once again tries to bring multi features under affordable limit. worst try. just used the phone for few days and the handset started displaying it\\'s faults. it takes minimum 4-5 hours to charge the phone. the handset gets heated up as much that you can warm your coffee cup. within 3 days off purchase, the handset started displaying software update alert. the camera is good but consumes battery as if the handset gets hungry while photography. not recommended until lenovo fix the defects. am sure, lenovo would soon pull out the phone from market.buy the phone at your own risk. good. but not as per description you can\\'t use 4g sim on both slots. only sim 1 is 4g cast setting of the phone is not working very baad battery backup and it takes long time to chahe 100% faltu maal de dia just love the k8 note. big fan of lenovo. started work a7000 then k3note . k8 note is way better then redmi note 4 or honor 7x. my friend has both. he was in awe of my k8 note camera and network speed. yes it meet my some requirements, selfie camera may be modified for more effectiveness this is a good low price but battery is very poor it is drain very badly just two days problem in touchpad. phone not working properly and i wasn\\'t able to connect with amazon for return superb mobile,nice camara they must use snapdragon awesome phone killar phone, awesome performance , fantastic looks, best price, no other companies are giving this specification in this price , stock android great , thanks lenovo , this is my 3 lenovo phone, still using a7000, k note 5 my family, me now using k note 8, nice the mobile is nice and faster with deca core processor but some of the features are missed..there is no wide touch ,no colour changing for notification light and it takes 2 hours charging with turbo charging third class product. don\\'t buy it. as amazon itself not able to resolve the problem camera is awesome, great performance, enough memory and storage space i wanted to use for few days and then write a feedback. its been 9 days while writing this feedback. my experience with amazon support and the phone is not satisfactory at all. the moment i got the phone, i did all the transfer of credentials. after a day, i started facing this unique issue regarding loss of my data internet. it would show the 4g icone with full network strength but there was a cross sign on that network strength tower. i realised very soon that i cannot access to internet as long as that cross sign is there. i had to restart the device or wait for few hours to get the things right. this used to happen atleast 4 to 5 times in a day.so i reported this issue to amazon via app. there was an option to select the return item option but apparently that link will ask you to talk to amazon tech support or install some software for checking your phone.amazon tech support sent a technician and all that he did was factory reset. after doing this, the phone\\'s data internet was working fine. so accordingly he mentioned in his service report and handed over the copy to me.but immediately after he left, i started having the same issue. i reported to amazon again. this time amazon customer care team tells me that technician did not find any fault hence you have to submot more proofs.i did that as well. but there is no solution to this. i check some forum online and came to know that this is a known issue with this device. had i known before buying, i would not have bought it at all. i received phone with sim card tray damage.. average phone not a good deal garbage phone friends don\\'t buy it and the way its price decreased prove it go buy any other phone of mi or samsung don\\'t waste your money may be next time its price come down to rs 1 lol nice device for high use.. battery is awesome. overall super performance.but i got my device with a dunt on rear casing so for that 4 stars.. this item is very good excellent nice mobile ringtone not supported after reading lots of nagative review of phone heating and frame drop while playing games....and average camera. i am not interested good future all function available thanks great phone, camera quality is very good. overall mobile performance is great. good phone but battery fast drain and camera quality is medium, otherwise is good good product i my box there is no ear phone nice but speeker is damage after one month use good phone only one problem is the battery getting discharged with in a short duration hm good performancebut there is still some lakh in playing gamesthere is mobile heating problemcamera performance is goodthere is some problem to connect phone to tv using cast screen... every thing is great, but battery drained out so fast even some time i have to charge it 3 times a day. great so many issues from day 1 had listed below, before buying this product check youtube video done by geekyranjit...1) recent button automatically enables frequently and there is no replacement for this phone - serious hardware issue2) led - led notifications, only blinks for unread messages and doesnt blinks for missed calls, whatsapp, mails etc...3) unlock the phone - when unlocked menu button is not working and need to lock and unlock again to get into menu4) dual cam - what is the purpose of this need explanation as what it does will be done an android app with better results5) juice - draines really fast, i have another version of lenovo it comes for more than 1.5 days but this one does not hold for an entire day6) turbo charging - it only displays turbo charger connected and it is not charging fastly7) dolby atmos - why and what is the purpose of this application, only to see dolby atmos demo video - there is no differentiation to identify - when you switch off / on it says / shows \"dolby atoms\" cant you take care of the spelling8) no headphones provided - you provide dolby atmos and you will not provide head phones for this price. i dint receive product invoice i need my warranty for my lenovo k8 note it\\'s good. but always when i make a call and raise the mobile it\\'s volume decrease by itself automatically. help me out. so far so good nice phone but inbuilt call record facility not available and key feature button light up option not available that is not that satisfactory don\\'t buy lenovo brand , because every second piece screen probe occurring and its life only 1 year.if you dont believe please lenovo service center then buy, and single scrach avoid you warranty so first think and buy lenovo brand. looks very ordinary and feel plastic body. product is superb , bt if u want dslr like camera u will not be satisfied .depth sensing is not up to the mark otherwise battery backup , deca core processor , front camera (with party flash) , charging time (nearly 2 hrs.) gives a very smoother experience . nice this mobile is heating. cast screen & many more problems don\\'t buy the casting function not available with this product, also after sale support is not good. frequently hanging #### my honest review ######* phone look is ok but is phn me kuch kamiya hai# problems:-1. jio call quality ok but speaker output is very low but music quality is ok2. dolby quality headphone is ok-ok not good not very bad3. bhai camera ok hai pr agar aap log raat ko photo loge bilkul andere/black kamre me toh camera 2-4 photo sahi lega fir sari photo kali karega update krne se bi koi farak ni pada same quality bs ek feature add ho gaya slow motion recording..4. contact show aur save ni hote phn me agar sim ke contact dekhne ho toh import karna padega sim save email id me honge only contacts5. no gallery6. headphone symbol,battery percentage show ni hoti manaually on krne padte hai iske liye aap koi bi youtube pr lenovo k8 note ki hidden tricks video dekh lo..baki bahiyo aapki marji mujhe toh koi khass ni laga phn...... most of the time dolby atmos goes off automatically and can start only after restarting the phone. i can\\'t give a single star to this phone because this is the most worst mobile there is no picture quality, no battery backup, bluetooth problem,heating problem very nice very good product no cast screen good very good product good mobiles for digital use. ram is good so speedly i am working all work in online is good heating and also quick draining spoils the performance. battery at its worst battery is draining very fastly. price is too high compared to other brand on same specifications i recommend this.. best phone ever......at this price battery backup not good bluetooth connectivity very bad awsome kishor has been satisfied wth this hand set camera disappointed me alot. depth effect doesn\\'t work as expected. nice performance.super fast performance it\\'s not a pure stock android and battery is not being optimised with its hardware. processor is not working with its full potential. most disguesting phone everrrrrrrrr.....never ever buy it!! battery drains like hell and very slow charging within 10 days of usage....hate it totally. very very bad mobile. awesome phone...very nice camera, sound quality is amazing...i love it..!!! the product has nothing as what is mentioned in information provided by seller or manufacture camera is a super fail where as dolby is just ordinary doesn\\'t work fast even with dexacore processor, antenna function doesn\\'t fully support 4g service with any service provider, battery automatically drains even in standby mode ,live wallpaper support are not up to the mark ,images clicked with both front and back camera are blurred camera flash is poor for creating a budget phone lenovo has forgot basics of phone software in my opinion phone is complete failure a worst experience of my life. phone is ok got at right price hope they will provide good service that is more important amazing the inbuilt is so nice and made by motorola. this phone is combination of moto and lenovo. better than any phones of mi because their phones are not trustable. after 12/10/12 update i must say the battery life has improved very much thumbs up. and the rapid charges up to 95% in two hours and 100% in 2:15 hrs. you can use it 1.5 days normal or 1 day heavy usage respectively. smooth running phone but there is diflections in jio network but without slowing the internet speed hope in the next update this will be corrected . good cameras + front flash . one step ahead of redmi note 4. brought this mobile in nov 2017, 2 month all working fine. then started network issue. even near to vodafone tower it\\'s shows no network. tried to switch on & off activity but no result. suggest not to buy this. phone review not good every where best performance phone for this

never appeared after the oreo update. i play pubg with this phone every day and sometimes lags slightly which is not very much noticeable but still there. i don\\'t keep many apps installed on my phone. i like to keep it clean and don\\'t know how good the games would perform in a phone with tonnes of apps installed. everythings okay except bluetooth. bluetooth doesn\\'t work properly! it sucks so bad, the audio lags terribly. tested in multiple bluetooth headphones/speakers and still the same. contacted lenovo multiple times for this issue and no help. if you\\'re a music person using bluetooth headsets don\\'t buy this phone, it\\'ll irritate the s*** out of you. i\\'m giving one star due to poor support from lenovo, headset nahhi aaye he mere mobile ke saath please do samthing it\\'s front camera is excellent not due to only it\\'s 13mp but also due to it\\'s iso which makes excellent camera quality with party flash and fast charger makes it\\'s perfect, and it\\'s fast

always in charge. update - 28-04-2018lenovo k8 note world wide has signal reception issues. the lenovo service center wrote and gave me this on paper after being unable to repair my phone.my phone was at the service center for nearly 2 weeks now for signal issues. even after changing the motherboard, the issue is not resolved.do not buy lenovo & moto phones. if you still decide to go ahead, please visit the service center once to see the rush!(wish i could give 0 star)the signal reception is very bad. most of the times the same sim which functions with full signal strength on other 4g phone will give no signal on lenovo k8 note. i have been begging lenovo, escalated till their corporate teams and their response is not even professional.in my 6 months, my phone has spent nearly one month in the service centre with no effect. cheap people at the service centre also. even the systems in their service centre does not work !buy this phone only for its camera.the phone is really heavy. the metal body will dent at the slightest impact. phone is getting too hot in minutes. don\\'t buy if just a dull product....i think the phone is not bad according to my friend\\'s opinion..but my set is totally a blunder.... good one. nice phone with low budget..nice 📷. super very good ... no issue till now. some minimum options are not there, heavy heat generating when playing games, display blinking......many more. battery wickets ..clean bowled in half day low battery life and inflatable problem lenovo is known for cheap and feature rich phone. lenovo note is its one of the most popular phone lineup. let\\'s see what phone has to offer in therms of quality and performance and what are its shortcomings.prosit is dual sim volte 4g phone which means it will work with almost every telecom service provider.full metal body. in this price range very few brands are offering full metal body.comes in two variants 3gb of ram and 32gb 4gb ram and 64gb gb. both variants has enough ram and storage space.note k8 note is using mediatake hellios x23 deca core soc processor this processor is very capable and its performance rivals with snapdragon soc.it is one the cheapest phone with dual camera with phase detect. the primary sensor is 13mp while secondary is 5mp. the camera is coupled with fast lens.front camera is 13 mp with moderately fast lens. both front camera and back camera has flash and they both perform well. video and photo has enough details.just like previous models, k8 note also has standard 5.5 inch full hd display. screen is bright and has ample contrast.now k8 note is using latest stock android. stock android tends to be more responsive than modified version and has less bloatware.it has 4,000mah battery with turbo charge support.it is water resistant.for music lovers it have dedicated music key.audio is very clean and supports dolby sound enhancement.has home button and back button.supports wifi ac band.it has dedicated card slot.support usb on go.cons:-comes without earphones.sim and sd insert and remove mechanism needs a pin to insert or remove sim or sd card.no nfc present.no infrared support.slow camera lens which leads to bad low light performance.does not have either usb 3.0 or usb c.even though processor itself support 4k video phone does not support it.does not have enough service center. service after sales is not adequate.battery performance and usages average, will depend on usages pattern and apps used:-charging time approximately 2 hours with stock charger.web browsing wifi and mobile data 10 hours.only calling nothing else 20 hours.video playback 14 hrs.verdict.k8 note is a feature rich phone which follows the foot print of older device. it would be perfect device it it had 4k and dust resistant support. nonetheless it is very competitive decide and i do recommend this phone as this phone has almost everything which will sufficient for most users. if you are looking to buy this phone i will recommend 4gb version as it offers best value for money.i hope that my review helped you. if you have any other question fell free to comment below or message me directly. i will be glad to assist you and answer all your queries. this phone no 64gb 51gb only and over heating very bad its a grate product good phone just after 2 weeks i got problem with phone. i have given in the service centre and more than 2 weeks phone is still in service centre. they changed mother board as well( service centre people claim so) feeling very bad about my decision on buying this item ,😢😢😢 great average good mobile camera quality low. awesome. blurr camera feature not in this phone rough quality very bed product. i give negative star if possible battery drains too fast, i think its not 4000mah battery. no way to return, rqst leveno via amazone to solve the problem by updating software, otherwise amazone will be resposible some nice parfamence so blanchard was very bad so change the launchr it s working well battery parfamence was very nice don\\'t buy this phone go for redmi or other brands .. it doesn\\'t performs like 4gb ram and a deca core processor .. lags most of the time after android 8.0 update... and the main advantage is u can boil rice using lenovo k8 noteinstructions : play a video , wait for 30 seconds , keep the rice cooker above k8 note .. rice will b ready in 10 minextra advantage : for survival purpose u can throw at someone to break their heads .. cause it weighs 10 kg ..sound effects r worst in it\\'s class .. selfie camera it\\'s like iphone 3gsoverheating issues .. battery s not charging 20 percent even if i turn of the phone never charge .. battery drains quickly i\\'m having only stock android apps along with whatsapp .was good only for 2 months ..people please don get cheated by this phone\\'s specs .it doesn\\'t perform like one .. i\\'m using redmi 5 2gb varianti would honestly say redmi is way more better than lenovothis will be my last product from lenovo . super mobile picture very nice it is hanging and not working properly 3rd class product, mobile have issues. i am not purchase any lenovo mobile. 3 gb ram phone every time hang. earphone not received with phone wonderful phone for the price , being used by my kid and can withstand rough handling and numerous uploads / dowanloads , no issue of hanging even while playing games. been using this phone for one week. good phone, battery backup is excellent, battery stand by is very good. overheat problem is gone after few updates. also got the android oreo update. about the camera low light photo is not that bad, what camera do you expect in this prize range, in daylight the camera is very good. about the speaker the clarity is very good. sometimes i do some street photography, i simultaneously use photoshop express, adobe lightroom and snapseed, i switch between this three apps, i haven\\'t notice any lag. overall it is good phone. writing review after using for 2 months. mobiles hangs a lot, heat issues. please prefer to buy some good mobile instead of this k8. this one is osm. wish there was an option for zero star.the new android update to oreo is not supported by the phone which is causing the phone to charge really slow after the update.ideally, a turbocharger charges in less than an hour but this one takes more than 2 and lenovo technical support is also full of lame and dumb people who will tell you that the charging should take 1 hour and 40 minutes (that is what a normal fast charger does and not a turbocharger).buy any other phone that already has an oreo update. best phone in this price range.decacore processor makes it fastest. great battery backup. good camera. good internal memory 64 gb and good 4 gb ram. battery life was not good performance... waste mobile..... iam using last 20days....😈😈😈😈my suggestion is don\\'t purchase this product ☠️☠️ amazing phone good worst mobile.. waste of money ... very baad phonecharging is not good good mobile in this cost..but battery is fake..its not 4000 something else..its draining too fast. best mobile i purchase this phone on 31/12/2017. this product is many problem like bluetooth is not work properly, any cast screen is not supported except chromcast, you can\\'t mirroring on your tv. the network issue is also found, the phone is many times out of range. bad camera nice phone.. camera is good but flash light is disaster it will damage your eyes soon..box packing from amazon was worst.. i didnt get earphone and there is only one piece charger. not good as previous versions the mobile phone i received has fine screen quality and average camera.the problem i am facing is the left speaker at the bottom stopped working right after two days of its delivery and i can only hear the sound from one speaker.i brought lenovo k4 note last year and it\\'s a great product but i can\\'t say the same about the lenovo k8 note handset i received.i didn\\'t expect this from amazon or lenovo would have preferred the lenovo features of recording, dual apps support etc. very poor battery performance considering it is a 4000 mah - doesn\\'t last beyond 18 hours. price dropped just after i purchased it. expectations was high when i purchased but it failed to obtain it\\'s respect. i used for only ten days and i observed that mobile getting heat at charging and on use of internet. it started hang after 4 days call is not connected immediately it take time.once it was stuck for an hour i could not able to turn off or to continue. hopefully it is a disaster for me. lenovo is manufacturing good quality products. but need to develop in camera section, need to add motion gestures - for switching of flashlight, opening of camera,....... ) where moto g5 plus is having this features. got all the important features at this price range, dual camera set up is not like redmi but it\\'s ok. waste product from lenovo very good mobile good good phone at this price.specifications are good as compared to the competitors.big battery lasts 8-9 hours when used continuously on high brightness but heats a lot. very good product you have to bay it on charging phone was heating. bluetooth is not working while connected the wireless heandset.front camera is ok.seriously on paper is good phone but on practice don\\'t buy killer phone can\\'t send sms of 100 numbers as admissable by trai, which my previous levano sets are having... no earphone heating issue and battery.....overall good phone fast work with lanovo k8 note there is no connectivity wifi miracast to your smart tv.common disign. when i receive the mobile & try to get switched it but it didn\\'t on ....😈👿 battery back up not good nice good phone bed product lenevo k8 note my phone nice overall phone is ok but it has heating problem, dual camera is not up to the mark of starting even no depth images captured as it was mentioned, little lags in games sometime. it has a deca core processor but still it lags with snapdragon 625 processor increasing cores will not result a better performance, no signal stability for volte, the price which they took is not worth device i got.too much costly phone but does not have and support basic features with apps even, no call recording feature even with playstore app it only record one side speaking person who have the phone but not of other side, does not support to use custom tones as ring tones, no stable 4g volte network, battery performance degrade very soon as compare to other smart range phones even having a 4000 mah battery very disappointing product i purchase, lenovo k4 note is far better than this one dumb product. good ok good it\\'s often hanged in any situation like online or offline. i just bored with it. dont buy ..drains battery super fast worst battery backup ( being 4000 mah battery) if u want gud battery backup dont buy this ...camera in depth mode is useless please don\\'t buy this phone full of crap, invest your money wisely in another brand. signal problem, heavy battery drain, gets hot easily , ultimately useless. wouldn\\'t give even one star but as it won\\'t accept i am forced to give 1 star. got this as birthday present and surely it\\'s a flop phone. nice phone, good performance.. good & nice phone. so excellent with fulfill all specification not bad not bad.... sometime music button not working....phone getting heat when it charging.... it not supported to skullcandy headphones.... amazon policy & amazon customar service is very bad and unhelpful. don\\'t buy any product on amazon because they all are cheater . agar koi customar ko product se satisfaction nahi hai toh kiya kare ?1 . ek toh yaha refund policy nahi hai . flipkart par se kuch bhi purchase karte ho toh woh toh 10 days ki replacement warranty deta hai aur agar jayada problem ho toh refund bhi de deta hai .2 . amazon customer service pai phone karo toh unka same answer & all the the time same records yeh hamaray rules main nahi hai aur yeh hamari policy nahi . hum replace bhi nahi kar sakte aur refund bhi nahi de sakte .3. lenovo k 8 amazon par se purchase kar k maine toh bahut badi galti kar di . main sabhi logo ko request kar ta hu ki amazon par se soch samjkar product purchase karay warna aapnay ek baar product khrid liya aur agar aap ko koi bhi problem aayi toh aap k paise gaye .4. you lost your money if any product purchase on amazon5. lenovo k 8 note very bad lots of network issues , call cleartity not clear very bad , battery drained i am havey use but only 6 hours battery 4000 mah ? r u kidding like a 2600 mah , front camera 13 mp not good & not led flash like a 5 mp. nice mobile phone with latest features overall good, but after 3 month one of the speaker stop working all good but back cover damage and heating problem and my cash back not credit in my account-fake offer very bad modal in lenovo dsp pandiyanthis cel phone parches last 46 days before not working so many apps ex ...true caller, call recarder, phone inbild. cast and ect .... and also saved incoming call not show name show the name ofter call ending ofter that 5 or 10 secwhat happand ths much of broblam must give me answer. dont delayiam very bad experience iam not give singal star its disply problem it is very poor phone .it can not work properly and it become heated. nice product. money paid is worth.cast screen function does not work. i just bought the mobile today. the same same-day, i identified that loudspeaker of this phone is not working good. it means not enough volume, no clarity not able to hear the incoming calls sound also. very worst and worst sound. so i\\'ve called amazon, they asked me check via \\'smart chk\\' app. that is one of the fraud app. it shows everything working in good condition. but i sure that there is defect in the loudspeaker of my k8 note. amazon like trustworth company, better shouldn\\'t sell mobiles company like \"lenevo\". then only it can maintain credibility from custolers. very worst quality. nice phone.. good looking and battery is good... product is ok, not excellent... great features at very cheap price.you can surely go for it over other phones of this category. i have compared this phone with redmi note 5 and 5 pro...beats them in many aspects. good best for the price value.it has got great specifications and user friendly! not good battery /camera not very impressive dont buy this phone. i m feeling regret by buying this phone. phones has many problems. applications stops every time we open it. phone has touch issues also. camera is the drawback of this phone coupled with laggiest proccesor. phone is good but betty is not good... i m fan of lenovo product... not good as lenovo k6 power its not upto the expectations.1. camera average2. battery back up is ok3. processor speed ok4. its get heated even for simple simple works...5. look and feel okmy suggestion is donot go for this phone. very unhappy with it and wants to return this item at any cost.. very very worst product...when it reached i felt happy and i opened and put the sim after that it started hanging as well as sound also not smooth.. bad phone. overheats, dual camera is useless. also, randomly stopped working, lenovo has outdated service center information online, the service center they listed online is closed off. very bad experience. i guess that\\'s what i get for buying a cheap phone. very poor performance.softwares are working irrelevantly guys don\\'t buy lenovo products. it\\'s a all problem mobile. waste camera, waste display quality, dolby atmos is not working properly. first watch this mobile any one hand than decide. don\\'t believe you tube videos or any mobile side. it\\'s not returnable. amazon and lenovo is not return the product. be save don\\'t buy mobile on online. go offline stores look, watch on your hand than buy. great phone for the price. it was an awesome phone which i supposed to have like it atlast i got dream phone which is having all features in it n it is different from all other phones receive broken display great and good performancelook like a cool and good if you want a portable heater which restarts on its own and take potato quality photos then go for it very very worst product , one speaker is not working. & charging adapter is not working if charging 20% when plugged in hole day is 20%,battery backup is not good.don\\'t buy this product. all hoopla and no performance. lot of software programming glitches and very unuser friendly especially if you ve only used iphone and samsung. back button on the left , 3.5 mm jack ob the tip and default opening of favourites all the time in call logs to just name a few. vowed never to use lenovo again. will take ages to come to samsung quality leave aside i phone. disappointing purchase. nice product but the hard cover with this product not good broken 2nd time dropping down also 2nd camera is dummy this is one of the best phones one could ever get in this price range.. the build quality is nice and all the features are great as expected. the services provided by amazon are excellent.. and the team is very co-operative. my last mobile was lenovo k4 ...compare to k4 iam not fully satisfied , mainly the software side.lot of features missing,no gallery,no nfc, can\\'t make our own ringtone .. battery drains fast.with out battery power wat to do with other features.camera side it\\'s ok..looks good..waiting for the updation... i bought this phone and regret my decision. i bought this over redmi note 4 just because of camera but the dual camera sucks it gives very artificial bokeh effect. and there is no option to turn off vibration for notifications as of now. i hope lenovo will provide an update for camera and some bug fixes. but lenovo is notorious for not providing updates even for phone priced higher than this devices. very nice phone i bought on 14/3/2018 at present no issues with handset as i got many updates.so don\\'t worry about reviews which shown in youtube.those are old ones at the time of release,at present it is a good choice very bad phone k8. better phone k4 product goodbattery awesomecast screen not workingrear camare quality badheading issue nothing good one turbo charger not working 12 hours need to full charge mobile is good. battery backup is also good. but whenever i click picture, image is blur. haaammmm, eye melting smartphone good mobile but price could be more reasonable worst product ever purchase, video casting not work. u can\\'t set ringtone from songs or other, only default ringtone . even 2000 phone provide these features. as i am exploring, i am finding more gliches in there system. i will refer never ever purchase lenovo. best phone for this price it is very nice looking only not working good network problems always network gone and bsnl sim message not going ? i am so tried and lenovo costumer service not good also they don\\'t know about anything phone. how to resolve this problem ... useless phone don\\'t buy this like most n useful .... tatch capacity is bateer than my older coolpad note 3 lite phone...... but charj r very quickly lagaing ....dept cemera is not to focus propery any object.... so picture is not too buler property. .... .. overall is ok & good... too pathetic.......better not to opt for this even if you have this as the last option. too much of overheating even while just browsing. when you ask for replacement, they do some check from there end and tell even having 40 degree celsius for ur phone is normal!!! it\\'s not even possible to hold the phone and the service is too low!!!! smart features, good looking, valuable product. camera to bad bakvas camera he good very good but missed call notification light did not show very good phone in my hand super best.. amazon delivery is good.,but i wolluld choose the worst product.,i would choose it for its battery mah and camera 13+5 but the battery life is very bad.,also the camera quality is very very bad .,redmi 3s prime mobile only have 5mp camera its beat the lenovo 13+5mp cameraandvery poor in focus .,,and zoom one of the worst phones i have ever used . within 7 months the motherboard and screen have stopped working and the service centre has not covered the product under warranty. and during the usage of 7 months the performance was much below normal good camera.. but 13+5 has no effect doing... otherwise worth it... courier service is very bad very best smartphone it\\'s processor is very good it\\'s support screen cast your customer service center advice for technical assistant help but technical service assistant do not solve lenovo k8 note (venom black, 4gb) battery not charging by turbo charger. kindly refund money or replace faulty lenovo k8 note (venom black, 4gb) .regarsthankssantosh rbt lenovo k8 note camera is good and battery performance is to good awesome phone with good camera. applications force stop, chrome and youtube force stop again and again, one of the speaker does not work. battery drains fast, poor dual rear camara doesn\\'t capture adequate quality images for depth mode. phone gets heated while charging. display is glitching very small pixel lines showing and disappearing while charging phone sometimes. screen quality is very poor just fell down only from 2 feet and broken badly and lenovo customer care was very bad service center also has very bad behavior i will never buy anything from lenovo company g terrible mob camera quality very poor. overall good product. hitting problems cemra is not good and not battery backup lenovo k8 note 2week after problem death mobile... amazon bad loss. pls its don\\'t buy lenovo k8 note. very nice and very cool stunning looking unbeatable performancegood looksgood battery lfeworth buying too poor quality phone pour it\\'s getting heated up very soon n ni8 the pics doesn\\'t have clarity, my phn is hanging many times i just bought it in the august. so upset with it good but left side speaker is not working bad overall satisfied with the phone!pros:looks good! gorilla glass very much adds to the class.dolby makes a lot of difference in audio quality. its one of the major reasons i decided to go for this phone.battery back up is satisfactory. easily lasts a day. there is some scope of improvement however.turbo charging is a plus.haven\\'t come across any heating issues.cons:facing issues with jio sim intermittently.call recording feature is missing.miss gallery. not too fond of google photos app.dual sim set up feature is rubbish. does not meet my requirements. no option to send messages from 2nd sim. the product not the water resistant bad qualities good product lovable features:camera, sound, picture, display qualities are very nice.problems:but it has heating problem when net connection is \\'on\\'.4000 mah battery in this phone does not long last even for a single day.(5-6 hrs only). worst pic in low light, depth mode is like a joke speaker not working, defective model & amazon representatives dont even care.. overall features of phone are good.camera is soo good, music player is ok.but the worest thing is battery 🔋,phone is like a battery line up of 2500mah. very poor response of this mobile, battery no run more then 8 hour and over heating problem occurs any time good himobile look is goodbut not bad product,charging complaintmobile very heatcamera clearty lowheadset not received price dropped ₹2000 after 5 days when i bought.ok phone. there\\'s heating issues. you get a cheap plastic case with it. camera is also not that good. depth mode looks like editing done in picasa. bokeh mode is pure amateur, you can apply better bokeh mode using photoshop. my advice will be to go for nokia 6, i wish i had bought nokia. design perfect, functionality perfect. but major heating issue. camera is also not that great. and also normal 3.5mm jack head phones are not compatible with this phone jack.very worst product.while recording video, near back camera you can here a uncomfortable sound coming from mobile device.if you keep flash light on for few seconds you can observe the heating issue. phone is good till now didn\\'t faced any huge problems. minor are there like battery doesn\\'t goes up to the mark. and mostly the main bad experience i got is it says helio x23 but in it it\\'s x20 it\\'s a type of fraud. and also it\\'s not 5.5inches it\\'s 4.65.. lenovo i have used k6 power it\\'s still my best mobile but this type of fraud behaviour you gone way down. quite impressive..gud camera and sound quality....overall gud phone for 14,000 mobile is not good battery very problem 4000 match is not only 2000 mh power very heating mobile i have bought this phone, when i have checked it i have found left speaker of this phone is not working, and on amazon replacement policy is very not good. very nice phone yar, good battery 🔋 sustainability, all apps are working waste mobile poor futurea display gone i expected that ear phones given to it , but not given . however this worth of that price. awesome product, good camera, decent battery life, best build quality. everything is fine, only the cons is device feels little more weight.. not as expected. rear second camera is a waste. so many useful things are missing compared to k5 note good mobile the phone becomes very warm/hot frequently. phone is a waste as it gets heated and amazon policy doesn\\'t allow to return amazing gadget in the price range.music key is extremely important function i found.front camera looks very impressive but depth enable mode at the back expected to improve by lenovo in next update.one major advantage of this phone is water repellent and sustain bulk of water on screen and at the back.last but not least it has dolby atmos system for music lovers which really satisfy your investment in lenovo, you jus need to buy some original branded earphones to experience the same. good product within the budget good phone this mobile is good.camera quality is average.it is budget phone, so do not expect more performance is not good. i heard that 4gb handset is better than 3gb handset. but even this one is same. also, one of the speakers is not working. to much heating prblm no battry backup no performance good.no features.limited option..very poor phone its only use a 64 gb sd card..6000 rs me bhi koi olx par nahi le raha h.. if you use it carefully, it works fine. one should understand the limitation of a mobile phone lot of basic apps like gallery, automatic call recorder,contact manager etc missing from the mobile. not satisfied with this basic mobile. excellant battery not good well, yeah my brother bought it not less than a month ago from amazon itself.. and it explode not while charging or so but while kept in a pocket.. he bought its 4gb model.. none of it matters now..lenovo service support is pathetic even after five days now.. they are still finding their executive to talk with us on our written complaint forget about phone i am much worried about my brother\\'s health. his leg got severe burns.i am sharing the photos and my review so that people can be aware of it. and one more thing no matter how good is your phone avoid keeping it in your pockets.. good phone... value for money... cemara is not good in lie light this is the best one from lenovo good battery drained so much after update to oreo. amazing phone ...meets all expectations especially camera ,very good very nice ienova product i like amazon full paisa wasool lookfull paisa wasool camerafull paisa wasool processorfull paisa wasool display with gorilla glassfull paisa wasool price.over allfull paisa wasool. good features, worth buying running great. according to budget it is the best phone. it has 64 gb internal space and 4gb ram which satisfied me. phone is pretty good as was expecting but the camera was not as good as was thinking of it with dual cameras on rear ones, but still it stands on my expectations. good purchase heating issue 🔋 battery drain to fast....not to buy anyone redmi is better than lenovo complete waste of money. very disappointed with the lack of so many functions that otherwise are present in the other phones at the same price range. very nice product. love the phone. lenovo k8 note is really a good one. its been a week since i started using this device. camera is the only thing which is not as much as expected.except that it is a killer phone. overall mobile is good ... camera and battery issue is there...soon lenovo will give us an update to resolve these problems...wait for some time.... average camera.. otherwise nice phone.. good performance. good often it hang.some time we try to send text messages from whatsapp key board slow and not work properly not a good phone. poor camera, poor sound and it heats quicker than my gas stove. network issue...calls disconnected automatically....no service found from amozon....camera quality is very bad...irritating phone.. got my phone today... awesome touch... till now it\\'s good all things is very good but camera and dolby sound system on average, dolby sound system indicator not working.......thanks awesome.. not for jio... u need the volte app for callimg and receiving calls. performance is slow charging time 2 hoursbattery back-up

product with this price good performance camera is too good... battery backup bad.... gaming smooth.... resolution is too high... charging fast.....😂😂😂😁😀 not working bluetooth and hit mobile it is so good to use, picture quality is nice i love to use this mobile. dolby atmos sound okay only. awesome i have faced a biggest problem that 2nd day the screen have become heat(warm). when i was touch the screen on my body it was so hot. now how i can solve this problem in touch of amazon company. another big problem is facing with this . that is difference colour of image than a original image. product is too much heating while charging its like iron,horrible. battery is draining, dead so fast within 5hrs. too much heat/temperature is generating while talking over phone. waste of money. nice. product pls don\\'t purchase this phone.bettery backup is so bad and too much heating. nice & safe delivery good product. today only its delivered..and its heating frequently with in first 15 min ...and this phone have a dash charging according to paper but it\\'s not like that ..its put on charge around 2 hrs for around 30% ..i\\'ll return it soon ... amazing phone with amazing features not satisfied... using 4 months.. dual camera is not upto the mark. sound quality lower than mi note 4. camera pic couldn\\'t store in sd card (set was hang those time). processer is best. cam. is awsm. it is excellent. do not buy this product as this is hanging after 6 months of usage ...will not work especially when internet is ondevice heating up frequently . good back dual camera not working only one work nd not enclueds headphone very good budget phone i say network signal is not detecting, after i update the software. mast phone.i have fallen in love. worst mobile,it is heating...it will use for cooking egg amlets... don\\'t buy this no use to take this phone better then take mi-a1 dnt take bzo amazon not given any exchange for mi do not buy this phone..i bought this phone on 25th flash sale ,received it on 27th and didn\\'t even use it for 2 days..though it is equipped with loads of features and good specs the battery is the worst..a basic feature of any phone and this does not even have average battery life ..i thought first time usage requires hours of charging but it does not charge not less than 8 hours for 0 to 100 and i had to always keep the phone on charging..and the company promotes it as turbo charging....and moreover it drains fast and could not even last for 10 to 12 hours though its 4000 battery..camera performance is below average and overall performance is also poor...don\\'t buy this seeing the killer features ,in reality it kills us with all its defects.... excellent mobile with the price, camera clarity is good.. i\\'m also using lenovo p1 turbo and in comparison to the k8 note the features are are very minimal in the note,sound is pathetic even with dolby,i\\'m using a jbl earphones. a part from ram internal memory and camera the note has nothing special like in p1 turbo.(open for suggestions) excellent i feeling disappointing about phone.1) this phone has no default call recording.2) no sellec all options in contact.3) no nfc very bad primary 📷 , quality vise is also worst waste its dolby is not supporting.. and second camera is only used for depth hi,i am totally not satisfied with lenovos \"k8 note\" mobile as it is a worst mobile with 4000mah battery which gives poor backup and the phones processing decacore is fake it seems because mobile is heating too much and the android system not working is a great issue as well as double tap and finger print clearly useless.will suggest don\\'t buy money waste if anyone purchase nice one good camera phone....good battery...value for money phone is does not better i change home address to office address but product delivered to home address. function well but camera quality isn\\'t that much what i expected bcoz it\\'s 13 mp camera. battery is draining to quickly compared to mi note 4 nice phone bukeh effect is not good but overall good one the performance overall was okay but there was a lot of heating issues. the biggest problem i faced was the poor battery performance. the battery when fully charged didn\\'t last for even 3 hours. i was given a preactivated product for the price of a new one.along with this very fast battery draining is a major problem. okay low budget and best future not bad nice phone. little bit hitting problem. i loved it not good awesome product .arrived quickly and works well. totally worse product.. do not buy...most serious problem: message,mail,sms notification lighe is not working. no option to off vibration when other end user pickup the phone no battery % shown in notification bar battery drain very fast with normal uses. overall good product, camera quality is not as expected, but its ok. lenovo should work on heating problem of the phone.userfriendy interface. good battery backup, speaker volume is loud n clear thanks to dolby atmos. compass , gallery options not available.....depth mode of camera very badbattery drain bahut fast hai..... a good phone but horrible in terms of batterybattery is not as promised no turbochargepoor battery performance and the phone even lags in the beginning itselfbattery drain is pathetic hardly stands a daywhich is not as promisedcamera not that good woth too less features it doesn\\'t work in 4g mode. signal strength is very week. not recommended. even they are not ready to replace the product. awesome phone ,with some added features as compare to previous lenovo handset as k6 or vibe or z2 plus ,this phone comes with one back cover which is an added advantage in this price range . price to be performance is good this phone is getting heated very fastly and the battery drains faster than k4 note. and as the ram was 4 gb it should not hang but it hangs while using with more apps. only one camera working. lenovo broken the trust as i already used lenovo k4 , vibe and lenovo phablet but this time i\\'m disappointed with lenovo . corners little like edge dolby sound quality is perfect. all features as given in description. it\\'s the best phone in low costone small thing is it\\'s some how heating while chargeit has borked screen within one month i have received my phone yesterday & when we connect this with charger then got switch off and after remove the charger it will start nice phone with nice battery life. not good experience....phone aaps open aoutomatically .......flash light open randomly.....bar menu scrolling down automatically.........which kind of problem is that.....i don\\'t know...i am customer of amezon.....i think they recognise problem and come with solution....either phone replacement or repair.. value for money i am not able to send direct contact through sms (text msg) , when i try to send it , it\\'s automatically convert into mms .not good .one more thing , screen pocket mode safe option missing.compare to my earlier lenovo k4 note .not feeling comfortable to use.its not user friendly like lenovo k4 note. not a good phone 4gb 64 gb wala phone bhi hang ho rha hai amazing features....only one disadvantage call recording not supported this is 2nd day of getting this mobile and heating is big problem, also this is 4000 mah battery but seems it exhaust soon which as a result heats the mobile, camera quality also not very exciting, not worth as we can get better product in the same price range.... a few very common features missing which is very strange.1. you can\\'t select any tune from your labs as a ringtone.2. it doesn\\'t support volte.3. there is no screen mirroring.4. phone gets hot after long usage.all these features nowadays are available in lower phones but somehow lenovo has missed to provide. any clue why? it is taking too long time in full charge i.e. 4 to 5 hoursits a bad performancesuresh kumawatbikaner rajasthan decent camera good battery backup. very nice phone having multiple issues with the phone, not even customer service of lenovo is of any help.phone is having heating issues and jio is not working. good performance nothing use of gorilla glass it\\'s single time drop from your hand definitely broken and if you going to replace the screen the lenovo authorization service centre ask rs.8000mobile cost rs.12999 but screen replacement cost almost 80% of the new mobile cost and service centre executive also refer you for buy a new onethink this reason then if want go for itno huge use of dual cameradual sim operation also some issue like 2nd sim is maximum disconnectedno new features like a redmi best performance. issue with charging this is a terrible product. i\\'m highly surprised that lenovo can make a such phone. received the phone 2 days ago. there is a network problem - it does not show any signal most of the time. when connected with bt to car for audio, the music keeps on hanging. further, the phone keeps on hanging when multiple applications are in use.such a waste of money. recommend no one to buy this inferior product. k8 note has heating issue while charging and moderate use also....4k battery but drained very quickly.... phone is good but low light pictures were not good and average battery life sot 6-7hours call standby 24 hours. please don\\'t buy this product..!this mobile phone gets over heat after the software updated....!? simply hanging often. ok weak wifi hotspot signal. long delay while trying to call - it takes quite a while to make a connection. phones gets hot very quickly. amazing mobile and nice features. don\\'t buy it if you are going for long battery back up. comparing to redmi note 4 it just useless phone. fully charged it hardly last for 16-18 hours only while redmi lasts for 36 hours. also, volte does not work phone is 2 gud, working fine battery backup is upto the marks, no lag , even when game playing. mobile getting heat for mild usage also camera range also not in expected range. phones goodbut emi it shows 666it is 702+33 rs taxi ended up paying almost 18000tax is on emi also also tax k upar air taxlike if there is 680 rs emi to there will be tax on itand than which they take as interest let say 30rs there is tax on that 30 rs as well we end up paying more 100 bucks than it\\'s actually showso watch

in 2-3 secondear phone missing thank you rating you r order good product mobile is heating and battery is not fast charge and draining fast. very bad phone i want my money return in charge time heating. dual camera is not working good useless phone.1. it does not work properly when you are playing music via bluetooth. sound cracks.2. mirror casting is not available. you have to use chromecast.3. overheating problem. leads to battery drain.4. dual camera in no good. normal camera of a similarly priced phone works much better.5. most of the chargers do not work with this phone. maximum time sim network problem, it\\'s a big problem, inspite of phone switch on , no incoming calls are coming i was used more lenovo mobiles. but this product i am not satisfied the phone volume and ring tones all very low. why? i am already increase the volume 100% . but still not okay.i am very dissatisfied about this lenovo k8 .any remedies are claim anywhere. please give to me some solution. thankyou good phone..but no headphone... still (7th oct 17) has some problem with 4g connection. when connected to home wifi calls are not coming. only when disconnected from wifi n connected to jio4g data it works properly. the product is quite good, though too early to rate now. but the phone didn\\'t come with an earphone. very good phone, go for it. speaker problem awesome phone just awesome.... good battery, good sound, awesome performance, just go for it. awesome mobile touch is super processor awesome turbo charging amazing everything is superb but battery backup is very low yes it is good and easy to use. mobile is super but sound quality bad(phone taking) good good good phone camera is bad sir/madam,i\\'m not satisfied with the product at all. battery drain is shocking , heating issue is there, screen brightness is low.after a new product is purchased how come it can have such issues. extremely dissatisfied with the product.last time when i purchased the dell monitor i was very much happy and satisfied with the product. but this time its complete opposite.in the return section i was asked to download the application for checking and analysing the problem but shocking it gave \"pass results\" which is actually not correct.i request amazon to return my money and take back the product.hope amazon doesn\\'t break the customer and provides fair treatment to the customer ok, so i will be one liner about everthing -- front camera - phenomenal, combined with front flash it is even better- back camera - could have been better, but still it is fairly good- faced no heating issues till now- sound is pretty good- haven\\'t faced any hang or any ram issues till now- looks great, feels good in hand good service and nice product. buy it this is very nice look and features.amazon service is best.. higher price point killer mobile right speaker only work, left speaker is not working. how can i solve v good mobile charger problem....mobile strucking ......heating pros..battery backup is good, turbo charger charges very quickly, finger print scanner is awesome.cons...rear camera quality is not good, little bit heavy for one hand users. takes time to search contacts (sometimes lagging), 4gb ram is not very impressive. back cover quality is cheap. have only one speaker which is not so good for music lovers (but in earphones good sound quality) . heats up during games and long uses on net. not good awasam don\\'t buy a product which battery dies within half a day totally very bad quality smart phone it is..very very very bad like good phone with this price range.. rear flash could have been better. battery performance is average i got his mobile on oct 5th tried to capture a pic ( selfie and with back am well ), but strange as it is 13 mp it should have good clarity where it is not upto the mark . the back camera 13 mp . but no clear shot ...images are very blurred. don\\'t buy this last month buy this on amazon within 7

for dual camera but i am not satisfied of this phone because secondary camera are not work in depth mode and clear photos as low light i hope the secondary camera is not any work here?my suggestion lenovo improve ur quality and features.there is nothing like what you are getting on the phone\\'s features if you are taking dual camera for a bad phone major problem is phone charging....every 12 hours it required chargingphotos are also not upto the mark.. normal device was delivered to me on 16th sept and with in a span of one week it had issue of restarting again and again while in usage (in idle too). approached the service center with the same... they took 4 days of time and returned me back saying there wont be further issues but in less than two days of their service mobile started behaving the same... still the mobile is in service center....finally my suggestion...before making a decision of buying a motorola / lenovo mobile please visit their service center near by. by seeing the number of people carrying their new mobiles.. you can come to conclusion that its waste of money first then waste of time approaching them. dont know why the companies still using mediatek thoug it makes a lot of issues?i decided not to buy mediatek empowered mobiles excellent mobile i love it not value for money. overheating everytime. better to go for samsung in this price range. mobile phone is excellent to use heating problem product is good, didn\\'t receive headset in box. its very good product , im too happy to have this product , amazon is grt camera disappointed me a lot. dull camera super very awful phone .though it has 4000 mah battery , the battery drains very very quick and also very slow charging .it says that it had a turbo charger but it is very very slow . it also gets lag often. it is getting very heat up when you are using dosti ye phone mat lene kyoki bahut heating hota hai product was good. camera quality is not good enough. nice processor. solid metal body is good. warms quickly. disgusting phone...many features are missing like screen cast, ultimate saver mode, scheduled start and stop, contacts are not getting saved...don\\'t but this phone, this is one worst product from lenovo lovely phone but camera performance low mobile is amazing only one draw back heating problem. send a invoice copy good phone super moblie very nice product worst battery backup it\\'s exactly one month since i bought this product lenovo k8 phone..overall it\\'s good.. but facing heating issues and slow battery charging 😐 runs very hot. else is fine

with the mobile.some scratchees in the back side of the mobile and the back case also.please do something with the sendor..if u can please replace my mobile. i have been using this phone from 5 days and phone is performing nice . but i mazor problem i have been facing in this mobile is that it is getting heat up even i am using hike and whatsapp i haven\\'t installed any game . even though it is heating too much . i don\\'t know what to do know . this phone is good but some time phone is hang yes it was great. received the phone but having and issue with screen power on off button, it works after multiple attempt... had a call with customer care and going to run the diagnostic test for problem, i would need a replacement since this seems to be an hardware issue. battery backup is very poor & over heating during short of time. rear camera quality need to be improved according to specifications. indian mobile sector is dominate by two kind of manufacturer, one who are capable of big marketing budget and another who offers mobile at cheap price. lenovo is known for feature rich phone. lenovo note is its one of the most popular phone lineup. let\\'s see what phone has to offer in therms of quality and performance and what are its shortcomings.prosit is dual sim volte 4g phone which means it will work with almost every telecom service provider.full metal body. in this price range very few brands are offering full metal body.comes in two variants 3gb of ram and 32gb 4gb ram and 64gb gb. both variants has enough ram and storage space. 4gb version offers best value for money.note k8 note is using mediatake hellios x23 deca core soc processor this processor is very capable and its performance rivals with snapdragon soc.it is one the cheapest phone with dual camera with phase detect. the primary sensor is 13mp while secondary is 5mp. the camera is coupled with fast lens.front camera is 13 mp with moderately fast lens. both front camera and back camera has flash and they both perform well. video and photo has enough details.just like previous models, k8 note also has standard 5.5 inch full hd display. screen is bright and has ample contrast.now k8 note is using latest stock android. stock android tends to be more responsive than modified version and has less bloatware.it has 4,000mah battery with turbo charge support.it is water resistant.for music lovers it have dedicated music key.audio is very clean and supports dolby sound enhancement.has home button and back button.supports wifi ac band.it has dedicated card slot.support usb on go.cons:-comes without earphones.sim and sd insert and remove mechanism needs a pin to insert or remove sim or sd card.no nfc present.no infrared support.slow camera lens which leads to bad low light performance.does not have either usb 3.0 or usb c.even though processor itself support 4k video phone does not support it.does not have enough service center. service after sales is not adequate.battery performance is similar to moto g5s. battery performance depends on background application, temprature, brigtness and usages pattern.charging time approximately 2 hours with stock charger.web browsing wifi and mobile data 10 hours.only calling nothing else 20 hours.video playback 14 hrs.verdict.k6 note is a feature rich phone which follows the foot print of older device. it would be perfect device it it had 4k and dust resistant support. nonetheless it is very competitive decide and i do recommend this phone as this phone has almost everything which will sufficient for most users. if you are looking to buy this phone i will recommend 4gb version as it offers best value for money.i hope that my review helped you. if you have any other question fell free to comment below or message me directly. i will be glad to assist you and answer all your queries. very worst phone as promotion shows that beat the mi note 4 . camera very poor , sound quality very bad . buy this phone only waste your money great deal in 12k i didn\\'t get expected camera and screen mirroring option is their or not every thing is ok except this two options nice so good product 3rd class product from lenovo.... uoper camera not working. its give only for look. there is no upper camera...its only have one functional camera. another is only for showoff this device deserves a four star and has all the potential to be the killer if only lenovo could roll out a software update soon.. with mi a1 in the market with android one there is no way lenovo could chiken out on these bug fixes...though the performance is fast and fluid, battery bugs relating to phone idle, mild heating issues, non functional dual camera( is it just a gimmick dear lenovo?? you couldn\\'t use the two sensors to deliver a real bokeh?? its just masking now) let me down... fix it with a software update lenovo.. gone are the spec games.. we need updates now best phone on this price range. nice mobile.only depth mode little problem.best mobile a good phone having all features battery,camera, screen,touch,memory fabulus don\\'t go with negative review for battery it\\'s hot during charging but not an issue coz metal body it met my expectations..bt..camera is not good..i wish i waited for the k8 note plus version..to get very sharp images. worst mobile ever! heating issue! it\\'s turn life heat producing mechine when we use it! no other simple words to say worst phone ever bought... network vanishes repeatedly after short intervals in a day...shows cross on network signal very often have to restart... sending back its not working properly , screen working with work, speeker now work. hang problem and eyephone not concted there is absolutely no use of 2nd camera and the phone has become even worst after oreo update.lenovo doesn\\'t cares much about your phone.so go for other phones like redmi or others.don\\'t buy this phone the best phone out of lenovo stable with a beautiful camera. it shoots in slow mo as well. videos come out beautiful. casting isn\\'t there somwhow... expected in next update to oreo. else phone is a breeze... go for it. better than me and honor 9 lite.dual camera at the back and selfies are better than latest mi... i used to love mi selfies but lenovo turned it around...i had a k5 note earlier... k8 note has better gui and smooth operation...forget vivo and oppo as well... the best in the class with a gorilla glass!!! i use this from 2 months. all most phone performance is good. also good for gaming. no hanging problem. there is only 1 problem in dolby atom. but in this price phone is too good. bad thing is that in box u can get only phone and charger nothing else. very bad phone. don\\'t buy it.! it\\'s battery life is so poor, not good phone at all one of the speaker is not working heating issue.not possible to go service center and wait for whole day for such issue.and it cost me to go near metro city like nagpur waist of money worst phone i have ever seen.. phone is heating like a hell.. for 3-4 months it will be ok.. after that the battery drains fastly but it will take too much time to complete the charging.. there will be connectivity issues also occur.. totally disappointed with this product.. battery is not up to the mark 50 % battery in just 5 hours with minimum internet usage don\\'t buy this phone don\\'t purchase everybody very very waste phone it is barely a month old, and it has already started troubling. it is in full volume and yet i cannot hear without using the speaker option. i have tried adjusting the volume as well as restarting the instrument, but no use. the battery also drains out very fast. i am clueless. now what should i do? please suggest and support. i don\\'t think i can rate this product for now. this phone is not good...camera, battery is not good... need invoice mobile is super but bill not coming best for it\\'s price awsm phone.bt slow mo mood picture

tooth doesn\\'t work up to the standard and have lots problem in connection with devises even though it get connected...songs doesn\\'t play....camera quality is poor for indoor. osm phone good phone at reasonable price. no lags or heating issues. battery power stays for about a day with full usage. camera quality is good but not for professional photography, although it has pro mode. nice turbo charger stopped working after 10 days of purchase. its horrible experience because amazon will not replace the order after 10 days.now i have to chase lenovo customer care team for new charger. it\\'s pathetic. lenovo team why you guys not test your products properly before launching to market. nice looks and amazing net processing purchased on 21 august and on 20 september it\\'s got formats automatically without my permission and erased all my data in phones and external sd card which have very important photos and videos. i\\'m in shocked that how it\\'s happened. i was just opening my lock to use my phone then a message appear on screen that phone is reseting... and i can\\'t do anything to stop it because no buttons were working. and can\\'t remove the battery to stop it... lenovo answer me who is responsible for it..? i want my data back.. out door photography in sun light is very good.indor photo are very low quality..speaker phone was not clear..high heeting issue.. sim card

upto the mark,it is way behind what it promise to be.lenovo please improve it. i like this phone amazing... superb mobile...... best smartphone by lenovo. it capture very good images. only heating problem 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. it is working fine except battery somehow fast charging minimize this factor but it feels that it is issue but everything else is absolutely ok phone is working smooth and every specifications listed in description are correct and available in the deviceonly one speaker is embedded, i don\\'t know why every phone provides that another blank space of nothing.bought on 4th october and package reached on 5th october so the delivery is fine and packaging was good.but on 7th october the charging adapter got short from inside, not working obviously, looking forward to replace it from the service centre.i will prefer this smartphone because its providing 2 rear camera for depth effect, but not that much good, at this price rangeit is truely a turning point of budget smartphones specifications adding 2 rear cameras in their list. good . well best mobile in this price range rs 10999.fastest free delivery got next day after orderedusing more than 1 week, small heating problem, charged in 1hr 30min for 0-100% and all day battery even if internet is on,can used only one 4g sim at a time that 1st slot,good camera but bokeh effect has some issue camera doesn\\'t understand the edges of object it also get blur. overall its really killer smartphone as lenovo says. thanks amazon and lenovo!! value for money product is good .but the battery performance is very poor not according to 4000 mah after new system update too many problems arise. it heats up too much, charging is very slow, in 2 hours it charged up only 15 to 20%, battery drianing very

#lenovo k8 note.i have redmi note 3 in my family since 1.5 yrs but they are excellent in performance as compared with lenovo k8 note.lenovo k8 note did not have gallery in its os.poor ram performance.poor front / rear camera quality & performance. very awesome product never seen before after using one week........camera is greatprocessor is goodscreen is goodonly battery management is poor. other mobiles lasts longer in the same capacity not worth for money ...gui isnt that good .also it has got no decent looks . if you are camera lover better dont go for this phone . battery is 4000mah still it wont go for an day if u use data connection gud nice nice one i am so happy heating n charging problem thanks worst product for usingcamera is 5mp back,2mp front:1any application close itself:2good looking:3 worst phone. heating and battery charging problem in 6 months and visited service center for 3 times in 6 months of purchase and still facing the same problem. worst experience. waste of money. worst mobile and worst camera lenevo battery performance bad booting and restart time over.and mager problem service centre help. no battery backup i m giving this feedback after using mobile fr one week...bought this mobile with high expectations but didn\\'t reach me... turbo charger z good but battery life z average... it\\'s very bulky to handle(180gms). cam z giving avg. performance... overall experience it\\'s nt upto the mark... can hv other option in this range... good product but do not support turbo charging.good service provided by the seller.on time delivery. very worst phone compare to lenovo k4 note . the back camera 13 mp . but no clear shot ...images are very blurred. the k4 note is better than this camera. the 4000 mah battery back up give only 6 to 7 hours when it fully charged.the 6 to 7 hours back up also come when you use this mobile in normal usage (like what\\'s app, facebook , mail checking). if u watch youtube video the backup come only 4 hours .the same heating issue also in this device . when call to anyone , i use loudspeaker or head phone only , bcz u can\\'t use the mobile directly in your ear .that much of heat was produced in this device . heating issues...... it\\'s under moto launcher so lenova additional setting options are missing... quite to improve software oriented issues big heating problem. awesome there is a lot of problem with network connection. the mobile data and call connectivity are getting interrupted and disconnected frequently. phone working performance is good, camera is descent. phones heats up frequently. the phone was good in every features but the battery was drining fast and not charging fast .. it shows the turbo power connected but requires 4hrs to full charge..other than every features was good.. i am a hard core lenovo user but this time i am not satisfied,i have got k8 note blue tooth issue ,music not clear,service center does not support,plz donot buy this product an unstable product. disappointed in this product. re-starting the phone is a major hassle frequently needs 3-4 attempts to start again.poor performance compared to k3 note, which i purchased earlier and it is still in good working condition even after more than 2 years. good one. amazing mobile phone.. and delivery speed of amazon... it was grt phon under budget average phone. its over heating on charging. spec all are ok. but heating is too much. average phone. there are better options out there in this price range.touch gives occasionally problems. also switching from wifi to mobile data does not work some times and need to toggle flight mode to get it working. nice phone it is ok appears normal & heavy weight. poor battery life camera is not as good as it boasts. the dual camera feature is not that great. giving 3 stars for the quick charge and battery back up alone. betry my chargers not functioning properly take 18 hours to charge really killerwhat pics #dual camera there are speakers in both sides of the charging port.but sound comes only from the right side.no sound in the left side speakers.this is a main issue i face.duel camera mode is fake...camera test..i opened the camera and put my finger on the back top camera.at that time no obstruction is found.then i turn on the depth mode and again put my finger on the top camera. this time also nothing happened. that means the top camera in the backside is only a dummy. it is not at all working. no problem.......great phone.....except orr gets heated up!!lenovo please fix this!! good service provide and nice product this mobile is heeting highly good one turbo charging problem and overheating probelm,network issue 4000mh bsttery drainning in 8-10hr max. heating up if multitaxing.turbo charger is just a name, nothing much. excellent camera, awesome looking, beautiful display,no hang. now i have equested for replacement to amazon. will update further after using another one. i got defective product now im waiting for my refund everyday phone restarts automatically after charging 100%. if does not restart phone hangs a lot. no system update is provided by lenovo to solve it. otherwise everything is quite good. it\\'s very nice to handlecamera is very goodinternal storage is 64gb selfie camera is good but rear camera are not up to mark.bokeh mode do not do nice.phone gets heating after a little use.but the performance for high end app games is nice.battery also do good will last all day for moderate use. so bulky and heavy on weight, looks good, not excellent. excellent specifications at this price first 25 days full speed chargeing but after that this is like a normal charger chargeing phone...not been able to understand what the hell is happening.....& i have buy it on 12999 & another person buy it same mobile at 11000 nice but camera???? i have been using this mobile for last 15 days,most of the features are flawless but the only concern is that it gets heated up pretty fast even though i have updated to the latest software update,i hope they would rectify it soon good service with nice product this phone doesn\\'t behave like it had described.i don\\'t like much bt it\\'s okh.. n also it is lagging... m giving this review after two days of use. i hope it\\'ll give me a update to fix my all the problems. i m refused to say that this is not such like lenovo says about that. v bad experience lenovo k8 note..due to moto marging just one thing do not focus on some of the bastards who comment false stuff about things over here. just go for it. and one more thing it\\'s antutu and geek bench scores are even more then that of oneplus 3. don\\'t believe it go check yourself. nice phone and worthy for cost compare to other devices best phone i don\\'t know? after purchase of that mobile next day it\\'s price is reduced 1000/- rs .so i wanted to return that mobile. how to return this.? worse product ... poor battery not as expected (i\\'ve had this phone for 5 weeks now.)the phone comes with a clear hard case (i\\'m pissed my case came pre-scratched and strangely stained) and no accessories except for the turbo charging adapter+usb cable.1. the primary camera is alright - i used to own a mi3 (2014!!!) and this compares with it, which doesn\\'t make it all that good for 2017. but good enough. i haven\\'t tinkered with the depth enabled mode but i know it isn\\'t flawless.2. the phone may seem a bit too heavy the first day or two. [i\\'m just glad i haven\\'t dropped it on my face yet :( ]3. the front camera is pretty good - all things considering - and won\\'t make you look too ugly, you\\'ll end up with bright adequate selfies.4. i haven\\'t had any heating issues like other reviews have mentioned, during heavy usage or while charging.5. the battery life is great and will last you nearly the whole day, unless you have the brightness on max, the wifi is on, sim is enabled and you\\'re continuously watching videos.6. although there is only one speaker i.e only on the bottom, thanks to dolby the sound is loud clear and pretty great.7. the headphone jack is a tad annoying, you really have to push your headphones in.8. turbo charging   around 2 hours, faster if you aren\\'t using the phone at all and it\\'s on airplane mode.9. honestly, stock android pisses me off. i\\'m used to and love miui.10. i got my phone in the very first flash sale (aug 25) so i had to settle for the 3gb/32gb version and it\\'s adequate.11. the call quality is good enough.12. this phone isn\\'t all that great at catching wifi signals sometimes though, my 2014 mi3 does better.all in all, it\\'s a pretty good phone, definitely won\\'t let you down (a lot) when you really need it to come through.but at this price range, you could probably do better. also keep in mind returning the phone will be next to impossible. don\\'t buy any lenovo mobile in your life ! i have visited lenovo service center 4 times in 5 months after puchase which i baught @ 13,999 rupees, but after 5 days it became dead after every few days continusly, the service center guys are very rude and not co-operative. after big disappointment, i threw my mobile in dust-bin for ever. please please don\\'t buy lenovo product ! bad lenovo k8 note product heating problems batterry problems, mic problems, please dont buy on online nice it\\'s nice. battery, display, sound all goodcast functionality is there, but not working as expected. my old k3 note connects smoothly to \"any cast\" but this one is not. camera is average, compared to honor 6x mera lenovo k8 note bahut heat ho raha aur hang b ho raha.very bad experience thank you, i received original product camera clarity is not good.its have dual camera but showing blurr while you zoom the image. waste phone... have network issue .. don\\'t buy... u will not receive incoming calls... over all best phone in this range not bad model but lenovo vibe k5 note no1 super fone under this price range....... good great experience till, worth for money. i have updated the november 2017 patch working as expected. planning not to update any more. the best phone on this rate superb mobile thanks for you i bought k8 note 4gb with new system update last week, but the phone is still in old android version 7.1.1. when i will get oreo update. it\\'s too frustrating.. all product is good great its not working properly its good phone. camera quality and screen is very good.mynphone doesn\\'t support turbo charging. infact its taking more time than normal phone for charging.i bought it feom first sale and its quite expensive. i find lenovo k8 plus is with same specs on flipkart selling at much lower price. little curved screen which makes it hard to find screen guard. otherwise product is owsome awesome phone....never expect these much quality.... very good mobile very good mobile and faster delivery.... awesome mobile..good battery backup..nice performance..no heating issue..super fast charging 1h.30min (0%-100%)#value_of_money worst phone ever. i did not even want to rate it a star. the phone gets very much heated up. and the the charging doesn\\'t stay for long, though there\\'s a turbo charger with this device. device is not worth taking. better go for mi redmi note 4. they say mi blasts and heats up,but it is said only so that the mi market comes down, it\\'s a cheap trick that are usually played by other competitors. i bought lenovo k3 note a year ago and it has network issues that were never been corrected by the service centre. and three months ago i bought another lenovo, lenovo k8 note, which is utter waste like k3. i gave my phone to service centre in jayanagar, and instead of repairing it, they broke the back cover of the phone which is non removable cover. this was experience with this product.so before you choose a product please do read the reviews. all functions good good excellent phone. it\\'s really nice model in lenovo and battery back up super. mobile not heating while using internet. so many good things are there in this model...etc... it\\'s complete all-rounder package from lenovo at this price range.i am extremely satisfied with this product with their great performance. very good superb camera thanks, i like lenovo k8 note network connectivity issue with phone.price dropped within a week of launch good performance good product as expected :) thankx to amazon camera is not good, it is a good buy however you need to buy a chromecast device if you wishto project the content on your tv. the phone is superb in that range the product is very good.front camera is very good,finger print sensor is very quick, display is very good and sound quality is very good but some things in that product is not good like rear camera and battery performance..but still the product range wise very good. good if you want to rock it\\'s the best platform giving battery problem....it can\\'t hold battery at laeat for 6 hours....also heats while charging best mobile lenovo is a waste product.. the turbo charger worked as fast only for two months.. battery is draining fast now... its now charging showing though it is turbo charger..i don\\'t know why.. bluetooth not workingbattery is draining off too fast. all the claims of superior battery life is crapcamera is a let down.want to return this product. nice mobile,except some minor bugs mobile is perfectly fine. i recommend it good sim slots,left side speaker not working ,sudden block signed nice mobile awesome product. but issue in system application. often many apps closes with a note as, not responding... hi everyone...!!! after 3 months of usage...i\\'m well satisfied with interface and features.camera is good...flash is well working...touch and display is very good.heating is a normal issue.bt nt so hot.cast screen is not working.so take a look on that.best of this price.battery is good bt drains some what quickly than other 4000 mah phones.bt battery saver gives nice power backup. no proper working phone is great, working excellent.. camera is good and the phone does it job well.. thanks amazon for the offer of 10k after 4day i write my true reviews by comparison of mi note 4 vs lenovo k8, forgot that last month my friend is brought a mi note 4 and i chose to by k8 note, hance i write my true reviews,profomance- k8 and mi 4 booth are same nothing feel changes,battery backup- after full charging mi is better storage battery power.gaming reviews- booth mobile is heating when i play clash of clan on online.charging- after 15 min of charging mobile is heating, i think this is turbo charger issue of k8 note,mi charging- when my friends mobile put in charging it beeping means on and off continuesly. that\\'s a bad reviews by of mi note 4front camera-k8 front camera is best then mi,back camera- booth looks same.display resulation and quality of display- k8 is good,if you talk about design k8 is better then mi but waight is more.flashlight- mi back flash is good then k8, but front flash is good k8, it looks like sony front camera.k8 is splash proof and gorilla glass that\\'s better then mi,when i using video calling front flash is not on means front flash option is not given on k8.after all things finally i gives 3* from k8 and 2* from mi...... mi is bad charging issue is so so bad..... short circuit issue may probably coming in next... thanks to all who read my reviews i can\\'t judge you but i hope you won\\'t not buy hopper mobile mi, in 1month it\\'s issue is coming looks his future... very nice & i m so happppy it is the best phone very very bad experience this phone heat a lot camera qualty poor worst smartphone charging drains away very fast .takes too long to charge. don\\'t know y is it called turbo charger. depth effect for name sake. heavy. dual cam waste. 10 core processor name sake.no audio recording. no screen shot capture editor. no app lock. worst mobile compared to note4. not in competition to it. even using battery saver is not gud. not happy with battery build quality , processor speed , storage options and game play are impressiveaverage camera ... seriously need to be improvedwill not recommend to buy good best of best speed, space, portable, look, cliarity......sahi hai bhai. good excellent mobile with all features and battery back up, camera are excellent. not worth itbattery - badcamera - bad killer mobile in this rangesuperb camera no heating issues using after 4months worth the money. positives - nice screen, fast, metal body, sleeknegatives: wifi & bluetooth connectivity issue (disconnect then have to restart to connect again else it will keep trying to connect and fails), fast battery drain when on internet no problem... good mobile..value for money my left side speaker is not working and also it is not at all speed charging device..it takes 1 hr to charge for 40prcnt superb product and care from lenovo it is nice phone i used a month experience.i don\\'t like it this phone battery backup. a very bad product with much heating problems ,phone always keep on heating either in idle case or in use. camera quality is very poor.. there is no image stabilization.. maximum pics becomes hazzy... i never seen dis wrost mobile😏😏no battery picupvery heatingcan\\'t use😠😠😠 very nice phone dammeged item overall all features are good. i found one issue: whenever i connect phone to my office wifi for whic it is asking me ca certificate which i select \\'do not validate\\' and i enter proxy. once i enter proxy and try to connect to wifi, phone gets restarted.phone is heating while charging.camera is not that good as shown in the videos. nice mobile nice features good excellent phone with nesessory features... value for money.... decent performance phone heating and usual battery drain after oreo update****************************************************************everything was great till the oreo update arrived. if you are in doubt, search for k8 note oreo update and you will learn for your self.after oreo update, the mobile always keeps hot even if its idle. you can\\'t even pickup the phone and put it to your ears. hope someone doesn\\'t get hurt due to explosion of this phone.the battery drains very fast. before oreo update battery used to last for 2 days for me, but now it doesn\\'t even last 3-4 hours. its even getting worse day by day.due to heating not able to put the phone in pocket or even not able to keep it on ear when call comes, even if phone was idle since hour. the phone is still in warranty and lenovo has no clue what\\'s happening.wish i am able to roll back the oreo update or return the phone.if you haven\\'t bought the phone yet : wait till these issues get resolved.if you have already bought : dont update to oreo.if you have alreay updated to oreo : god help you(like me), and start saving for another phone.hope this helps and save people from getting burnt (literarry) by the phone.-anup some settings are not there compared to k4 worst phone don\\'t buy it\\'s good ....but it\\'s have a poor problem.. #jio sim card\\'s network is very low... decent mobile. got satisfied with it! superb phone phone great nice phone , but does\\'t have decent battery life.otherwise excellent.. worst lenovo i have ever used. the phone heats quickly. don\\'t even feel like handling it. looks like i am stuck with it until i find another better phone in the market. the lenovo k8 note smartphone is superb, looking very nice, working so fast and excellent. i am totally satisfied with this product. thank you amazon. in this budget, this is a very good phone. only thing is both sim will not be 4g at a time, and when call is coming in one sim, other sim is not working means missed call also not coming. worst phone evernot even basic features like sim and 4g are working properly wonder full not satisfied with this phone.fast charging is just bluff.it will not charge in minutes.dolby sound is disable always you can\\'t turn it on.camera is also not up to mark.my previous lenovo k6 plus has good camera as compare to this.and also it don\\'t have auto call recorder and dual app inbuilt app. depth mode is poor but mobile is superb awful dolby is offing. suddenly. charging not capable worst product battery problem in 3rd day not so good as per my acceptance camera pedda bokka and audio system very worst and waste of money to buy this phonecamera not good audio system very bad, always hanging, slow booting .pedda bokka phone in telugu the box dropped somewhere due to this the back cover has some scratchs but the mobile works fine some bugs are not solved read this photo poor battery backup drains very fast, photo quality also not gr8, rest good verry nice & high colety, i like lenovo k8 note,...battery is super ordered the phone and now the charger does not work, got it replaced and now i see that screen cast is not work with any smart tv, bluetooth connectivity is also not good device keeps disconnecting. not a good device very good battery backup👌.. good processor after using 1 week i face heating problem with tis 9/10 built quality is good,9/10 battery backup is good.7/10 real camera, works fine, as like normal camera, don\\'t go for this if you are buying this only for camera. as i thought that camera is great, but its so so.. okie okie...10/10 processing is fast, doesn\\'t lag, works smoothly.heats a lot, while charging and while playing online games, like clash of clans.charger makes too much noise, you cant use this in a packed room, produces annoying noise.10/10 finger print sensor, best in lenovo. only phone is good....but can not canect with it tv. no option in phone for mirror casting.... the best advance technology producti like it first time i switched my phone brand from moto to lenovo ,overall good phone ..cam 8battery 9overall 10 out 10plus point is gorilla glass .... thanks very bed product b.t. not working properly very much hanging , slow internet working , camera very bed very bed experience from amazon nice phone... bt battery back up is small compare to redmi. camera is aswom... it has all the specs one needs in a 14k price bracket. battery life of this mobile is very bad...only 5-6 hrs battery backup...and it\\'s been 2 months since i bought it. device heats up a lot even when kept idle which leads to faster battery drain.lenovo needs to sort this soon.rest is good. very nice as per its price -camera to battery all good- very super performance...camera quality is exxcelentbattery back up is very good within 1 month of use, started hanging.one major draw back, it does not support miracast function. so you can not connect it to your smart tv. surprisingly youtube can be shared with tv. so they are forcing us to buy chromecast. this is not a standard lenovo phone. no call recorder. back button on opposite side. i love the phone. . this phone gets heated up very quickly. there is no gallery, video player or music player. however, google\\'s photos and play music apps are pre installed as a substitute. primary camera is good, but the depth enabled mode does not work as it should. we can\\'t use zoom feature in depth enabled mode. really amazing overall product is gud in performance. camera is good. battery drains much, lasts one day on moderate use..slight heating on charge...remaining all process r excellent very slow process.... cannot record calls. battery is alright lasts more than a day. battery drains so fast and it\\'s not dual sim 4g ! better go for other snapdragon processor phones a+++++ worst phone... the dolby atmos is not working, no data connection, no wifi connection shows, back light automatically lighten or brighten, automatically closes apps....frequently phone hangs...phone heats up... i wish i could give 0 stars.. camera is not good for low lightelse all things are very good. fantastic phone overall good very good phone in smart price. horrable performance with volte sim card. poor coverage and always give message of switch off to remote person who is calling. so.many bugs in volte software.camera quality is not as per expectations what lenovo is claiming in advertisements. camera response also very slow.depth mode is givien in camera but useless as after taking snap you have to edit photo and editing tool is also poor. audio quality is average. not satisfied. not worth of money. better handsets are available in same price. very disappointing , not up to the mark, returns issue problematic. only replacement possible but amount not refundable. best mobile in medium range money comparing with top company mobiles . gorilla glass,all other things are good.speakers are good but it will give some low volume and there is nothing fault about lenovo k8 note.it is good in price with all features camera is to develop.. both sims are not working 4 g slot 1 has not 4g option at this price, its worth buying when you compare with redmi series. camera quality is not upto the level. looks good. only drawback is the turbo charger is not at all good, it took 5.5hrs for the battery to full from 7% and no where its called turbo. battery back up is little fine. for 14k you cannot expect many features,overall its worthy. nice phone glass breaks for a minor fall. otherwise the product is good bad phone...wifi signal is poor not even caching wifi few steps far from the wifi device really killer experience... no volte. low signal catch. do not buy this. got the mobile on first sale. of the main aspect of the phone on which lenovo was emphasizing was dual rear cameras is not good at all. the depth enabled mode is totally of no use neither is the depth editor. all other aspect of the mobile is ok. a honest suggestion is to wait for mi 5x or coolpad cool play 6 . the web support of lenovo is also of no use. raised a ticket on this issue still no answer or reply from them. god knows whether they ever see to mails or not. i made the mistake of buying this phone, all of you out there please dont make my mistake product is awesome.delivery is very good .i thanks to amazon that they provide a back cover as free for my phone .thanks for lenovo to front gorilla glass also. lenovo k8 note mobile phone completely all product in problem bettery quality and quantity does not camera working and this phone heating problem or audio problem awesome mobile for gaming. fully storage free. very good phone- received before the date given heating problem automatic phone heat when phone is not in use or in charging phone gets very hot while charging. also does get hot on regular usage too.also it is very heavy compared to past lenovo phones, i also own k3 note, it was lot lighter and never heated up.* also the turbocharge doesn\\'t work very good nice, i has purchased lenovo k8 note in jan 2018, it was working perfectly fine, a good phone for its worth. lenovo rolled out the oreo update in may 2018 and after that my phone has almost been crippled, the phone is taking 8 hours to get fully charged and the battery gets discharged in 5 hours, it gets heated like anything and has also start lagging. i have also done a factory reset as advised by the online customer care executive but it did not help, hope lenovo releases an update soon. awesome phone, worth every penny.i\\'ve already ordered 2 myself and recommended to 4 of my friends.believe me i\\'m a heavy user and it\\'s awesome camera quality is so good but video quality is so bad network problem mobile has heating issues, quick battary drain and no standard volume. we need to fix it. damaged piece delivered. simply a wonderful product, best i could have get in this range..... average...i want something better but that\\'s not. v good. fuddu phones don\\'t buy this phone.heating problem ,bad cemra ,fake dolby atmos,fuddu performance,total fuddu phone it doesn\\'t have alot of wallpaper\\'s only one ...plus lenovo launcher doesn\\'t have battery percentage & internet speed option .....everything else is ok so far .... i am satisfied with product. i mentioned good & bad features below.bad:1. some futures are not there which are there in k6 power mobile. like junk storage cleaning etc..2. main thing we are not to store contacts in phone memory.3. mainly some futures are missed in status bar main features like...,network speed indicator, screenshot, vibrate mode, lock, etc.... some futures are not there.4. notification lite blinks only for normal messages, calls, mail, it is not blinking for whatsapp, fb messenger etc....any other app notifications.  > i am expecting (main status bar features)that some of the features are i mentioned above will give in next andriod version.good:1. performance is very good.2. i am satisfied with both front and rear camera clarity.3. battery backup also good.4. screen clarity also good, mobile came with gorilla screen no need worry for tempered glass.5. main thing is mobile will not getting heat. i am very much satisfied in this.6. sound clarity also good.7. stock android version also good.8. eagerly waiting for android 8 update.overall mobile was good. not have a impressive battery life...but multi tasking is good...camera also avarag not good nice to use... but nothing is special in this display and sound are amazing in this handset. mobile ok... good delivery.. but not comming in cashback(10%) i am using this mobile for last 1 week. its heating more while browsing and playing games and battery getting drained very fast these time. otherwise its good and battery lasting for 1 day. main camera is outstanding from lenovo but depth of field is not that much good. the edges are getting blurred. overall its good product in this price range very bad........it\\'s hanging whenever m using 3rd class mobile dont waste ur money, jhakas fantastic mobile very good nice product by lenovo.using till now for 8 months not even a little bit of lag and superb processing time my lenovo k8 note mobile 0%emi purchase my credit card se 14% interest liya ja raha hai kyon this product is amazing and it is good look goon one in such rangeeee software not so fast as expectedbattery normal like 3000 mahcamera is goodautomatically turning off while using the cell very bad camera quality with this price range , front camera capturing only mirror image.plz don\\'t buy to see it\\'s deca core processor and 4gb ram & 64 gb rom features if you want good photography mobile. tl;dr: this phone sucks, expected much better from the makers of moto. even moto g5+ is far better than this.long version:my previous phone broke so i was in urgent need for a stopgap phone before waiting out for the price of lg g6 to drop. shortlisted honor 6x, lenovo z2 and lenovo k8 note. bought this, after 10 days of use here is what i thinkpros:+ photos are decent (compared to my last two phone that promised great camera but delivered little). the bokeh effect is not as good and huawei\\'s implementation.+ no bloat. it has stock android. now stock android\\'s blocky icons aren\\'t my favorite but you can change that with a launcher.+ programmable music button. i use that for turning on the flash light.+ front flash+ dedicated sdcard slot.cons:+ lag. despite a deca core processor and 4gb of ram, this piece of fine machinery is lagging, not on an intensive game like asphalt but clash royale. even my mom\\'s redmi 3 will run that flawlessly.+ battery. another indicator that numbers don\\'t always match the performance. i gotta charge it twice a day. and i miss fast charging.+ notification led: only white, not red or green, but only white. no led flash for missed calls, the most important use of that led.+ software. in many little ways, the software seems much less integrated with the hardware compared to even moto. battery poor quality nice great phone.... worth lots more than what one pays for it. phone is good.some function is missing as given in other lenovo mobiles like call recording, internet speed meter phone call receive near ear etc. waste of money looks good at design and all areas. only needs improvement on battery. no hanged till date. camera is good. that 14k mobile when touch the back sensor screen lock open but again touch screen not locked . unwanted person when touching for sensor at screen unlock condition it was not locked . that future are there 10k worth of mobile moto e4plus good one waste phone..poor camera performance, waste battery very poor.., gallery, call recorder and so many applications are missing. worst phone possible . it is not working with 4g network . once calling the operator tried all options they say bring it to service center . do not buy this phone . no hanging mobile i mean please purchase without any bad think prompt delivery.value for money product. nice phone waste products , it stop working suddenly , my all lenovo phone , working properly fine for 1st year and after that , we got major issue in screen , some time in it hardware. it is better not to buy lenovo , or buy with extended warranty for 2-3 years. good luck but better choice to buy other phones. think before you buy this product, lots of setback but lenovo support team doesn\\'t seem to think about it. network and headphone volume is few of the major concerns as i can\\'t return this now on amazon. still waiting for an update that fixes few of the issues. good phone. poor and limited ui. in display have a green color small dot in right side.i can\\'t satisfied to but these mobile very bad phone waste your money internet is not working properly updated review after posting it on 31st january for the updated issue read the last 2 pointsnote :- the review is been posted after using this smartphone for 6 days after i bought it through amazon independence saledespite having such a wonderful hardware configuration in this smartphone there are lot\\'s of software bugs which ruined this phone even after the latest updates which i have listed below, i hope lenovo provides a stable software through future updates :-1) all incoming messages in the phone are delayed by 10-20 minutes like all otp messages or any kind of messages which made me annoyed especially while doing bank transactions.2) random power off issue. phone gets randomly switch off while charging or while turning off the display by pressing lock button3) battery backup is very poor i guess this is a hardware issue not a software issue because phones like redmi note 4 gave me almost a full day battery backup has i\\'m a heavy user and this phone gave me 7 hours of battery life it seems like lenovo has cheated us by giving a label of 4000 mah battery backup which i think is only 2500 mah battery installed in this smartphone.4) dual camera setup is just fake especially the depth mode from that 5 mp depth camera, in short it\\'s just for name sake that this phone comes in dual camera setup.as far i have encountered only these 4 issues if i face more issues will update my review till then go for mi a1 or redmi note 4 has per your budget atleast those phones have a stable software configured with their phones hardwareupdate :-5) phone gets hang very badly while doing multi tasking though having deca core processor you can only run maximum 4 to 5 apps in background what a joke seriously right, to overcome this hang one should do hard restart by pressing the power button for 10 to 20 seconds6) another software bug is with notification light which is single white colour. no rgb notification light found in redmi note 4, but the true software bug is this notification light only works for pre installed applications on this phone. that means notification light won\\'t blink for third party applications like whatsapp, hike etc. but the notification light will blink for messages calls and gmail apps, another software joke from lenovonote:- if i face more issues will update my review this product is not for lenovo k8 better than many phone with a lot more price... this device is zero star rated wrost phone ever.. i trusted lenovo k8 note for moto branding owner, but lenovo k8 note just wrost ever,1. turbo power charge is just for show0 to 100 take 7 hrs to fully charge, and when charging device get ultimate heats about 50℃ and battery is wrost, in phone idle battery last 5 hrs and always heat the phone, main issue is the battery and charging issue , other wise phn is good, u have always plug the phone in charging socket to use, lenovo k8 made fools customer, please dont buy this phone, buy mi phone, good not bad good mobile worth the money spent on good performance but heats up quickly.....charging too slow...shows 6 hrs until full even with turbo charger bought a 4gb ram variant and posting my 2 day experiencepros:-snappy fingerprint scanner-camera works amazing in well lit conditions(both front & back, high quality photos can be taken)-supports volte & video calling (had to turn on provisioning using *#*#4636#*#*)-snappy app performance-good ram management-no heating issues-good internet speed on jio-no bloatwares(stock android experience)-additional music key-speakers are loud and clear-selfie flash is a good featurecons:-no backlight on home button-camera produces more noise in dim lightning conditions(photos look like they are taken from a 2mp camera)-battery drains much faster than it takes to charge-takes approximately 2 hours to reach 0-50% when switched off-the hard case they provide gets scratchy just by normal handling-no earphones in the box-unable to turn on front facing flash as torch my lenvo k8 note takes more than 4 hours to get fully charged so what should ido now anyone help me what to do now ???? please bettey very poor performance and legging wasted for many camera is not upto the mark its just ok, jio network gets fluctuate all the time, battery packup is just ok, for security update also lenovo is very slow, some issue with stock android over heating this mobile is hang many time for 5 to 12 hours some times hang, average battery and camera also very worst mobile defect from the word go.don\\'t believe in amazon anymore. worst camera primary and secondary.other wise all good. good lenovo k8 note it\\'s nice phone,camera quality is ok,battery backup is average means if you not used phone then also be battery is reduced and if you used or seen movie then battery is less discharge.turbo charger is very fast charging.it\\'s main disadvantage is if you seen less resolution quality video then that video is blur because it\\'s full hd resolution phone.i suggest you if you interested to gaming or seen full hd movie then you buy this phone. back camera uality is not good...but overall phon is good.... vfm product.lenovo needs to work on portrait pictures.no complaints yet after 6 months if usage. camera is not so good, mi mobiles have better quality in single 13 mp, other things are better than other mobiles. but waste of money if purchasing in view of double camera. seems the video clarity is not good. the sharpness is too high and we can see so many dots in the video. i have lenovo k4 and the same video played on both k4 and k8, the one in k4 seems to be much superior and smooth to watch. when i checked with others who bought the same, everybody has one or other issue. seems this was released without much quality check, i am disappointed! how can you call lenovo k8 note a smart phone??? without recording facility???? also, very slow processor! unimpressive camera.lost my money! avarage phone 11k this phone not a turbo charger i can buy but i m not satisfy this phone feature lenovo is always waste product... camera is not good at all.. sound quality is very low and phone is very .heat neither call record nor any apps support smoothly.full waste of money about 14k best all is quite well working except battery heating issues.. also has hd clarity issues in cast... gives low resolution while casting.. also no 4k recording yet will maybe rolled out in further update.. very good product. bt. earphone is not available with this packet good guys please don\\'t buy this phone... seriously it\\'s waste of money... duel camera is just a gimmick... battery drying issues... performance is poor...too much of network issues don\\'t get disappoint like me... heating to much but the charger doesn\\'t work .. very smart phone and smoothly camera n sound is good but it\\'s not enough.battery is taking 2 hours for full charging.only google photos app.no default app for gallary.no app for music player except play music.heating issuefingerprint sensor is slow. waste of money and time.. brought this product recently. not working properly with android 8.0 update. phone is discharging in minutes and taking more than 7hrs hours to 100% charging. while using the mobile its heating like a iron box...totally hated the product then amazon replaced the product with a new device and again faced the same problem...service centres are also not answering properly. one of my friends also brought the same phone before 3 months. he updated the system to android oreo 8.0 and then the hell started in his device. we went to the device centre and asked to take the backup of our personal data for resetting the phone. we did it and handed over the device to them. in the evening they called us and told that the problem was rectified and asked us to collect the device. but the next day the problem repeated even more aggressively than earlier. then we went again to the service centre and again explained the damn story. then they changed the battery and gave us the phone back. but the next day again the problem repeating. so we finally went to them and asked them to replace the device with a new one but they said there is no such option to replace the defective problem and they can not help with the device problem. finally one of the technician in the service centre told us that the problem is for all the k8 note devices after updating to android oreo 8.0. then we asked him to degrade the android version to nought 7.1.1. then he said they doesn\\'t have the option to degrade the system update and told us that he\\'ll inform when the degrade option is available with them. it has been 1 week since he told us. but till now we didn\\'t received any patch for this system update or degrading option. so i suggest you guys please stay away of your thoughts of buying this product....have a good day... guys,please don\\'t buy this phone it is totally waste of money.some basic feature like screen casting also never works.no zero rating that\\'s why rating with one star. getting heatedcamera quality too badtotally disappointed with this product not upto the expectations good bakwaas phone overall phone is good..but the depth mode of camera is not working properly. dolby sound not as of dolby.except this every thing is good everything else is good except camera they are trying to improve the camera by software update but the improvement is not up to the mark good its an overall good product but the oreo update isn\\'t readyly available. the 4000 mh battery is just there to support the 10 core processor it dies not give an extended battery life. the mobile heats even on simple activities such as movies. the mobile body is great as it is full metal. the in-depth mode is a just show please don\\'t buy this phone because of it is taking 8 hours to fill the battery , battery consumption also very more battery getting easlyy down many issues with phone1 does not support call recording function neither third party apps2 dolby atmos doesnt work when called support they say every time clear cache and restart your phone3 phone does not support volte4 many third part apps not supported5 battery drains fast6 over heating sometimes makes you scarry7 phone speaker not of good quality sound cracks at 80 to 100 percent levelnormal ringtone also cracks8 no updates from lenovo to fix the issuesso a bad choice nice .. excellent.....luv it this phone is best phone. its processor is greate and it works perfectly every thing is nice here... good battery... stock android interface... camera okay... infact canera is better than redmi note 4.. but okay with the price . .. never hangs.. no heating issues ...good fingerprint scanner... fast processor... what else we need at this price...😆 i m not satisfied with my setit has issue with brightnessand clock is not showing correct timealso has heating issuei would not suggest to buy this set not satisfied as phone doesn\\'t have cast screen option to wireless connectivity with smart tv, although other lesser value smartphones hv dis feature...very disappointed.plus battery back up is worst....really bad.. after using this mobile phone for one month, i am writing this review.the main issue of this product is heating.during charging or even using it for fifteen minutes raises the temperature by at least 10 kelvin.the turbo charger is not good enough.also the touch buttons below the screen are not back lit.camera is just average. low light performance is very bad.design could have been better. little bit thinner would be good.i think it\\'s just an experimental product from lenovo.i don\\'t suggest anyone to buy it.i feel that lenovo should immediately stop selling this product and recall all of them from the market asap.if there is any way to return it, then kindly let me know.mi a1 is far better at the same price range. battery drain problem.... otherwise it is ok lenovo k8 note is above from any other sub15k range smartphones from lenovo but average in overall ratings. and little bit of heavy .lill bit of heating with continues usage .camera department is above of any other smartphones of this range but exception is it\\'s dual camera setup which is only a hardware setup in smartphone but software is not that much supportive wuth dual camera setup. front flash is soft and quite good.stock android is impressive with it.processor is not battery efficient as 4000mah not last long for a day. 4000mah battery is good on paper but in day to day life it is somewhere 3200mah.build and looks are impressive.led notification light is point to consider.considering k8 note as a multimedia smartphone is fare ti rate it. sound quality is good display experience is also good as well.dual sim and dedicated sd card slot is nice effort with the fone.dedicated music key is good to have and ability to enable it for various operations is appreciabl.fingerprint security is only upto lock unlock but you can\\'t let it to secure any of your apps without any 3rd party apps. yes it works in capturing pictures through camera.stock android is that much basic that even you can\\'t hide apps in app drawer. it looks good but feels little less that even yiu can\\'t hide unnecessary apps. the phone is slow than lenovo k8 plus. k8 plus is better. rear camera depth mode and bokeh effect is not up to mark as expected.heat up[ while turbo charging and gaming. it\\'s good. over heating issue while light usage like just in internet connection, and always warm while connected to internet. this update is after usage of 10 days. dont prefer this one. good nice phone the screen is not like gorilla , it\\'s display broken very early. pros1) finally the camera is awesome in lenovo2) deisgn is not a merit but it\\'s okay for cost3) so far smooth performance didn\\'t hanged.cons1) if you are staying in hill stations as usual lenovo is carrying the exothermic mechanism which liberates enough heat to keep your hand extra warm2) turbo charging really works good but the bad thing is battery doesn\\'t make you to feel 4000mah. just stands for 5 to 6 hours of jio use3) stock os lacks lot of customization features that were available with earlier versions. the os is just basic (raw) no value addition had been done.4) lenovo should concentrate on network ic (signal receiver) never shows full tower. so network consumes so much power i think so5) no headset? i mean, really? this is absolutely madness.6) speaker is of low quality don\\'t believe any fake review. this is the best phone in this price range. no heating problem. no problem at all. buy it as soon as possible. the mobile is not good as it is shown .it has network problem& also toch performance is poor battery backup is average. screen guard can not be install properly because of its corved display. received the used piece, all the application were pre installed and you can see the images i\\'ve posted, (on aug 29, 2017, received msg from vodafone customer care).note: today only i received the mobile and last saturday i ordered the mob i.e on 21st jan, 2018.before buying anything from this seller pls check weather you received the new product or the used one, anyway i\\'ve raised the complaint regarding this let me see what\\'s going to happen. there\\'s no cast option in the phone.which has to be present .something seems wrong with the camerathe video doesn\\'t have many options. handset is looking good. camera is not so good its ok. battery backup very poor ya i know there is big big ram latest processor but it\\'s too much drain fast while i am just whats app chatting. and turbo charger is very slow it look like ordinary charger. for 50% it\\'s took 5 hours. and one more thing i don\\'t have any kind of game or i m not playing it online but battery drain more than expectations. its not worth price. it is best for ₹ 8000/- max ₹ 10999 amazon service is superb. lenovo k8 note is an average product. there is no inbuilt gallery in it and there is no more ringtone options of our choice other than inbuilt ringtones. i am disappointed by purchasing this mobile. 1)charging issue taking 15 hours for full charging2) music button working as simultaneously3)touch performance low4)fast discharging not worth of 4000mah the built quality is good and also the texture is fine. but the main problem is the phone is lagging little bit and the dual camera(depth mode) isn\\'t good.now come to the point- 1) lagging ___ the phone start to lag after the first boot up. when i was doing multitasking the phone start to lag. the phone is running on android v7.1.1 nougat operating system with 2.3ghz helio x23 10-core processor and 4gb-64gb of ram though the phone is lagging so much.now come to the second point 2) camera____ the front facing camera is good and the back camera is also good but the dual camera mode, i mean the depth mode is very bad, the dual camera couldn\\'t recognise the item that\\'s why it blurs the whole item and its the biggest problem in this phone though they are providing us a dslr-like depth-of-field effect. one camera has a 13 megapixel purecel plus sensor, bringing in high-end imaging capabilities. the other has a 5 megapixel sensor, which simultaneously captures depth information. this means you can view real-time bokeh with up to f/1.2. excellent product by lenovo.4gb ram 64 gb rom - enough as per my requirement.camera is good. picture quality is good.sound quality is also good.battery life is ok.no problem with the phone as of now. very bad phone display is not good the phone has nothing except space.!! i was way excited when i bought this but now totally disappointed and i was out of station for a week so was not able to return the phone. so nothing is good on the phone except you will get space i was using k4 note before which is far better than which leads me to buy this but now i am totally disappointed with this.1) heating issue2) camera quality ok ok.3) nothing special about this phonedon\\'t go for this . killer mobile , but only purchase on special offers or when discount available. heating up to 50°c nice phone, no problem the pics clicked are all blur no matter how we hold the phone. poor battery backup & home screen display on top double blur network connectivity, battery& phone sound is bad.i\\'m very disappointed worst mobile i have ever used.i suggest every one not to buy this mobile it\\'s the best phone under 20000..aswm processor..camera...heating issues neglegible..no probs faced yet after 2 months of use worst camera quality... pictures are being blurred & pixels are tearing redmi note 4 camera is working better than thislot of features are missing like double tap to lock the screen,, soft keys,, etc one of best phone with low cost. features are good. if you know how to use then it will be best for you. not worth it..my first buy online and the worst decision ever..writing this review after using it for over 5 months..problems faced1. merged contacts - this is the worst thing to happen.. all the contacts are merged automatically..2. battery drainage - battery does not even last for over 8 hrs3. worthless dual camera - dual camera is just a selling point else doesn\\'t solve any purpose4. quite bulky and heavy to handle5. lot of issues with system failure and apps not respondingtoo much to handle for a phone worth 15k every are feature awsm but phn ka weight bhut hai yar carry krna bhut tough hai fully satisfied with the product. timely delivery and best price. must buy luck wise good but narrate and second cemara is not good pleace improve the phone has network issues. the network signal is never full and fluctuates a lot on this phone. just google lenovo k8 network issue and you can find a the lenovo forum discusion on this topic. the issue is not resolved till now in lenovo forums. it started after nougat 7.1.1 update. this issue is there for motorola phones with android nougat 7.1.1 update also. this could be an android nougat 7.1.1 issue also, not sure. phone with hundreds of factory defects1. battery draining in 5-6normal usage2. screen showing white lines, blinking3. wifi loosing network, reboot required4. networks loosing again and again, wifi required5. software have multiple bugs6. multiple apps gets hangs, do not responds7. quick charger takes 3 hours to charge phone batteries that last only 4to 5hours8. mobile keys placed with awkward design, complete useless design9. bulky phone with useless design10. finger print sensor and camera placed at same place, you can\\'t use phone without backing cover11. average build quality12. no after support available best present smart phone problem is network connectivity very cool mobile to use and the battery backup, when compare to other mobile its very good. but camera quality is poor. otherwise super cool. camera quality was too bad...depth mode and night mode and room mode was too bad quality don\\'t buy friends... used mobile sent by amazon. charger is not original in box. earphone not given and mobile also faulty. camera quality not good and found heating issue. worst cameras as price consideration..both front and back👎 its not having volte ...camera is also not impressive as expected battery drain very fast. consume very much memory. heating issue comes after continuous use. low light camera disappointed. when playing video picture quality not good may b colour management is very bad. above all not good for price. highly recommend. worst mobile and service given by lenovo. fantastic nice i got a faulty charger. what i will do now? liked it. dual cam doesn\\'t goes well otherwise worth for the money awesome phone phone is good... battery backup very poor nice phone dolby atmos app not working. app crashes.scratches in covers. all things are best but they should improve the camera good mobile good but many features which are existing k4 note, not available in k8, sound quality is not good, camera not satisfying. otherwise it is good. value of money lots of network issues phon produces heating effect only conc i saw in it.. other wise phon is really asome dont buy this mobile tiger on paper but dog in reality. .....and most worst thing amazon not giving refund too. camera clarity bad though, the phone is having 3 gb ram the dialogue box occurs showing not responding in some apps.sometimes the apps get hanged.these problems i am facing since 2 days.i got the phone 4 days ago.ihave other lenovo phone which has 3 gb ram and 16gb internal storage ,the phone doesn\\'t have this problem. good phone in this category and price very good phone but had issues with the sim. i pity lenovo and moto buyers. not even a single phone manufactured by them is good . every single piece have one issue or another. waste your hard earned money for this chinese it 7777 lenovo k8note not support dolby both speaker not working, only only one spekar working everything is wonderful except with some notable issues like patchy camera performance nd the autofocus not working the mechanish of autofocus only works after touching the screen, bokeh effect is not that accurate nd the phone heats up while multi tasking it\\'s awesome phone never and ever at low price i think this is best phone at this price.camera quality is superb ,usable ram is more than 1.5 gb , missing some features that i had in k3note like \"wide touch \",\"dailer\",\"ultimate battery saver\" but this phone is really awesome awesome, good.... gets really hot when playing games in non-ac environment. while mobile is hot, even if its a non-game app, it gets very laggy. bad battery backup. and recharges very slow sometimes, while using the same lenovo charger. poor signal reception. all in one phone..very nice. not so advanced phone considering the following features:1. no backlit navigation buttons,2. no call recorder,3. not much led notification settings options,4. also, back button is placed on left side of the screen,5. very slippery body,otherwise a ok phone in this range. excelent product hand phone not include in box accessories.. super fast delivery. i loved it only thing that made me unhappy is you guys said that phone will be updated with present system but it is not.. except that awesome 👌 as specified. this phone is not up to the mark..heating issues.lagging in opening apps.poor camera. indeed a best bet at this price! totally would recommend this phone! very good phone its a nice phone,but it heats a lot when u play heavy games and the quality of the back camera is not that great but its nice and the front camerais good it is very fantastic phone it was superb.... charging is not so good.... ,poor charging capacity...! mobile is ok but there is network issue very bad network in primary sim and second sim slot always change to no network anytime full network there is issue in network otherwise product is best battery backup is good thats amazing😚 i luved it.. bt i regret dat i bought it soon.. i wish could wait for diwali offers.. i had bought it for 14000.. nd now.. it\\'s only 12000😔 really it\\'s an not good mobile as i expected..... i like very much lenovo k8 note.long battery backup, good picture quality. phone is very good...but i miss headphone this mobile good product.. with this price not good one compare, very poor network reception, very slow camera, slove in responce, the product was good but over whieht @quickly getting heat and also no provided the new massage typing facility but over all good excellent product & excellent service from amazon the best phone ever with best features at good price acc. to me better than redmi note 4 phone is good but the packing of phone was very bad it\\'s like gali ka item pakda dia h.. nice it\\'s a worse product especially in battery performance....although battery is 4000 ma but it seems like it has merely 1500ma...bluetooth connectivity is very poor...i will not advice this to anyone!!!! lenovo becoming more more better and good ...need more colours i think low battery backup but quick charge , then charger adaptor was repaired soon. discharging fast.signal not connecting it\\'s rebooting automatically.mobile is hangingi need to return back. everything in this phone is amazing but someis issues are1～it feelsis a littleis heavy2~it tendsis to heatis up whileis doing normalis usage.3~its depth mode is worse. must hai i returned it worest product nice one null faltu phone.. heating a lot 4 star everything is ok....but mobile is heating too much. lenovo should do somthing (system updation) for heating issue. don\\'t go for this and if you buy, don\\'t buy from amazon at least product once sold with pay is never refunded though how worst the product is as this phone burns on ear piece after a charge or browse. overheating while travelling worst very very poor quality phone i ever seen of lenovo, worst user interface which have not any smart activity although it is smart phone! total loss of 11999. not worthy mobile. lenovo don\\'t care for customer once you buy it\\'s products, never purchase it. you will find better option. also poor return policy as the user can\\'t change his mobile once purchased. don\\'t west money.. please go for another option overheat and battery parfom very bad nicwbut display clarity differs from white hd display, along with free cover, deca core, 4gb ram, dual camera, selfie flash, separate sd card slot along with dual sim and of course 5.5 inches... complete package in this cost. awesome phone very smooth and very user friendly major issue is network issue. and also battery drain very soon. totally i am not satisfied with the product. don\\'t go for it. depth mode is not working properly....is look to be an average phone.best for gaming... good worst product k 8 is third class phone, k4 and k5 is batter phone, but k 8 is very cheap phone in this series, no any sensor, no call record , no smart call receiver, this phone is hyped as a decacore high performing phone but in reality my old k5 note is faster. two major problems that i noticed so far - audio on bluetooth breaks up very frequently and this is not isolated to my phone - do a quick search on lenovo forums and you\\'ll see that this bug is in every k8 note and lenovo hasn\\'t bothered to fix this. also, if you plan to screencast - you\\'re in for a surprise. this feature isn\\'t there and you\\'ll need chromecast to screencast - lenovo says that this is as per design. this is not because of a hardware limitation. some people have enabled this feature by rooting their phone and adding some 3 lines of code which lenovo can add easily, only because google wants to promote chromecast, this has been removed. big disappointment. very normal phone except front camera. bluetooth connectivity is worst. display quality is very normal. mast jazab...battery not up to the mark rest perfect in 11 k very bad image quality..... very disappointed.... poor performance..... good no screencast. music button not working. heating is another problem. system ui restarts frequently very good the product was good and the mobile is too good for it\\'s price...they dint give u a headset and there was no screen guard been using it for 8 months now.. no problems whatsoever.. great updates from lenovo.. warast phone this is cool mob in this price absolutely great features in this price.... nice phone with decent specs and all expected functionality working. mobile is cool yr......all good feature in only budget money best ph heating issue on charging. good camera phone .highlights of this phone is dual camera i bought at 13999 and now you can avail it in 9700 if you use card.big value down in just 30days of launch😅 ..nothing great in phone ..battrey is not too good..my turbo charging stopped working in jus 1month..not happy with lenovo phones i love lenovo i have received the box incomplete. camera quality is very good. as i tested, i don\\'t feel any problem with my phone. i have used nokia htc etc from last so many years. this is my second lenovo phone after my k5. still love lenovo good and satisfactory product.batery is very good.dslr enabled.but rear camera is not very very very good. good mobile good in this amount battery backup is not good...drains quickly.and bokeh mode is not effective.consider this before buying. over heat radiation. after long efforts now it is reduced 30%. othrr than that everything is superb..especially picture quality is too good.i\\'ll give zerostar for heat issues and 4star for features i got this phone a week back. it\\'s turbo charging not working and it\\'s taking 5 hours to fully recharge this phone. need replacement from amazon or manufacturer but no such option being provided on site. please help. awesome phone in this price.and delivered in time.everything is satisficable.👌👌👌👌👌 worst experience,i was told that technician visit will be done to sort my problem but technician called and told me to reset my device.after reset,my problem wasn\\'t sort out.so i came here to again file replacement but me there is no replacement window available.technician\\'s contact also deleted in reset process. great phone almostlenovo want to pack headphones in the boxrear camera is not good enough but it is ok good 10% cash back nahi hua hai. superb! it\\'s a good thing, yes it have slight problem of heating, but what\\'s i don\\'t like about it is that you can\\'t choose ringtones from music. phone is good but it,s pries is to high 10000 max........... awesome device on this price. it has been around 45 days since i purchased this phone..the problem i came across is with the charging!even if i m using the original charger cable and adapter its charging too slowly. whats the use of the so called turbo charger when its taking 8 hours or so to charge my phone fully. i dont know if its some kind of software problem or problem with the charger. the customer care is also seemed clueless when i told this problem. please come up with some useful reply this is a very very worst product i but it ever ..this mobile have a lots of problem when u using it regularly.. major problem is bluetooth connectivity.. it\\'s irritating when u hearing songs & watch videos through bluetooth head phone .. wifi connectivity also very poor... bluetooth interruption is too much ... pls don\\'t buy this product best phone under 13000 nice phone hung during use of google app but overall features wise in this range very good phone good amazon faltu product deta hai not working vebrate plz solve my problems good & best bad phonemy phone battery not working gooddon\\'t buy any one using lenovo k8 from last three days. little bit warm during camera, gaming, and navigation. but overall it\\'s very good. phone is excellent ... only problem is it gets heated up if your battery is down to 40 percent , even after updated it is same ..may be some more updates is required... find everything fine battery should be more signals are too weak, not worthy waste of money n time, i want return this phone😣tried this phone for two days low signals on any network. ek star dena jruri h ni to ek star v na du isko to itta ghtiya phone good product nice product. average battery, barely goes over a day. ui is smooth and very fluid, a bit heavy to hold. camera fails to start, but when it does its average, depth mode is a scam! any third party app can do that better. even dolby atmos sounds gimmicky. apps load quick but dosent stay in the memory. out of 4gb, after 3 weeks and some basic apps, i\\'m getting around 1gb free. poor app management. i wish i could get a refund. had high hopes from a company like lenovo. mobile lenovo k8 note 4gb ram , is the best mobile in low price .all fiture is good. battery not that good not last for 12 hours in medium use,no gallery,no ear phone, ear phone socket is hard to push and pull ear phone, ear phone sound quality is not good,ram is showing 63% lots of bloatware, delivery is very slow waited for a whole day despite it has reached my area at morning 9 am. amazon transport service is slow. worst plz do not buy, weak lte signal, also forget about bluetooth audio ,it will biffer in any headset i think best this is best phone but 1 problem i faced that the company has installed media tech which is not good for high graphic game it started lagging and heats up the temp. gone up to 45°and that\\'s not good but else if u don\\'t play games the no other phone is best then this it have best camera, dolby , front flash and many more thingsi request to lenovo that please use snapdragon .. it\\'s the worst phone i have ever seen . the camera is not working properly, there is always a network problem and while calling the voice is always broken . and you are not refunding me for that phone . i promise that i will never buy any product from this site 😭😭. i want my refund hitting problem not good.. as per expectations.. its ok ok since after a period of six month this phone has stopped working. after six month mobile stopped working while it was charging but centre asking for repair of this mobile @rs.12000/- as they opened the phone at the centre without our presence and they told us that it has been damaged duty to water. but i m 100% sure this is false and fabricated and centre making money by levelling anything whatever they want by any means to make money. this is harassment of customers of amazon and in future i will not by electronics gazzets through amazon in fact now i will prefer to buy physically through store so that they will repair it. all online buyers getting harassed by these service centre. wrost phone ever..with in 6 months its phone speaker got damaged. also, the phone is geeting hot too much.do not buy this phone. battery backup on bad parform battery backup poor.lot of heating issue processor is very bad .often restart and restart best performance in range. no words to say . best smartphone at this price. good price and nice

nice cons:front camera image appeared like mirror.camera picture quality is not good. does not look 13mp camera.phone is bulky and really heavy (including back panel).back key is at left side, which

both front and rear cameras have good clarity. good phone smooth and exilent very good feeling 10 out of 10 phone was good some times hanging battery was good what an abominable race us humans are in, going to deca-core now. bought for the cousin, he\\'s gaming all day and wondering why phones switch off when playing for one hour or more. and that kid now uses a back cover to prevent the heat from affecting his gaming concentration. kudos. thanks for reading this rant. supar excellent mobile worst phone awesome phone good hanging problems and camera not open good budget smartphone...in

the performance or quality as described. facing issues with battery performance after available update of oreo (android 8.0) . battery charging is taking a lot of time , in 1 hour there is only 10% charging for phone. the drain time is drastically more in comparison to charge time. processor is quite powerful which does great job and phone doesn\\'t hang even on heavy usage but down side is it consumes more battery which feels 4000 mah as \\'ok\\' option rather than great. camera quality is good. overall deserves 5 star. this is very highly reputed company and also 12999 rs cost of mobile but handsfree not available with this phone in the box. so bad so so charger very bery bad there are lots of problems in this product ( lenovo k8 note)1) it\\'s look like second rear camera is not

lenovo k8 another product was dispatched.delivery person was suspicious. not able to send message good phone , amazing application......i like this phone.the lenovo k8 note mobile is the good phone i like it.... good display. good camera. good sound quality. but despite 4000mah battery, you get notification about battery draining apps and asking you to close them. stock android with slots for 2 sims plus sd card are plus points pros: decacore, value for moneycons: only single sim 4g, camera qulity is just ok good phone. a value for money, a must-buy mobile phone. tough competition to samsung, etc. on price point and on features list. excellent performance. bought it on launch date itself. recommend all to upgrade their mobile phone to this \\'killer note\\' today. so big size awesome android phone for lenovo don\\'t purchase it below par in every respect ,no return obtion. note supported volte it\\'s good as of now performance wise. battery back up is nice. camera is also

best phone for this price local quality product, hanging problems and charging is very slow. 7 hours to full 100 % charge, waste phone in my life... in one month i go to service centre 2 more time slow delivery, but product good with 4 👍 is 2nd rear camera fakeif not why then why there is no option to use it and even there is no change while clicking photos by putting finger on this 2ndry rear camera.and with turbo charging i am not satisfiedit takes too.. much time to charge ( charger provided with phone is of 1 amp only, it should be of at least 2 amp) i was excited with my k8..but my expectations were wrong.mainly phone gets heat.4g signal strength could not able to get.back camera is not as good as.photo gallery is missingbattery percentage is missingsms always ask sim is missingi doubt speed as well.overall not happy sir ji mobile ka bil gum ho gya dusra bill chahiya tha kyuki charger krab ho gya please help not up to expectations.. it\\'s okay, main pros includes dual sim slot and separate slot for memory card n good internal memory n ram... main cons are over heating issues and battery drains out at a faster rate.. but can be managed with a turbo charger.. worst rare camera..... overall good performance,drawback customize ringtone not able to set super very good quality phone and shipping is awesome fast. the best phone i ever purchased. great specifications at an affordable price. i have been using lenovo k4 note since last year january and this is a good upgrade. great looks, great battery backup and great picture quality. good very good product this mobile is bad first time very bad experience with lenovo. bad display quality no gorilla glass protection scratches coming on display.. and important app are missing like gallery and many more...i\\'m boycotting lenovo. this is the first time i am reviewing a mobile as i wanted to help the others before buying this phone. this phone is good for a budget of 14k, i have bought 64gb, 4gb ram model. after a week usage i see the ram speed, browsing net, switching to different apps is really fast. no doubt the interface on android ver7, it\\'s a great user experience. but there is a major problem with the battery as plenty of them have mentioned on their comments. lenovo claims it is turbo charging but it takes minimum of 2 hours to charge or sometimes it varies,, close to 3 hours as well. battery draining quickly is a terrible product defect. i have an issue when the battery indicator level comes to 15%, it goes to 2% in less than 3 minutes and it shuts down. i have highlighted the issue with a video evidence to amazon and fighting for a replacement of phone or refund, not sure if the same battery issue repeats to my replacement phone as well. i am also planning to post a video of this issue in youtube. in general a 4000 mah capacity battery should stand for at least 2 days with a minimum usage or 1.5 days with a decent usage, but seeing the comments from most of buyers, i think this is a manufacturing defect and lenovo should really see this issue, get it addressed immediately. if you ask my opinion, wait for few days, revisit the new comments posted by the buyers and once the battery issue stands resolved, then go for it. end of the day what\\'s the point of buying a mobile with a battery issues? it\\'s like buying a vehicle with fuel injection issues,, it will not last long! worst phone damaged ... heating issue...camera worst.... awesome service excellent product not so good , lenovo a6000 plus is better i have ordered it on 18th august at 12:01 pm. got it on 19th really nice the amazon delivery. and overall phone is good. but i have a question that will camera quality better with the next update? phone hang use after four month plus more heated sometimes super good speaker problem if you don\\'t want to waste your money..please don\\'t buy this phone...the worst part is you cant even return it i little bit hated this product when i bought it from amazon since the battery was draining too fast. but, after recent software update from lenovo for this product, the battery backup has become very good. now i can feel like this phone has 4000 mah battery power. good performance and battery backup poor app management finest phone very nice set .... it\\'s run to good... worst phone full heating issue and battery draining nice mobile. heating problem such a fack amazon nd fack phone not good good heating machine amazing phone at such a price point price should be 11000 the lack of tiny features was dissatisfying...but overall it\\'s a killer phone ...by tiny features i mean it doesn\\'t have a sound recorder. price very high this product is worst..if any one need they can take it from me.. the product is faulty, amazon is cheating it\\'s customers as it is becoming popular in india. they refused to replace my faulty device.. microphone is not working properly...not at all satisfied with this purchase. will think twice now before purchasing smartphones from amazon...all my trust level on amazon has became zero after this order. battery drains too fast even if its kept idle and it does not support auto record during phone calls no charging but over heat camera performance is very 3rd class it\\'s too good, very nice phone.. good one but little heating. love this item can\\'t believe.. that also by amazon.. its a rainy season and still they don\\'t care. though deliver was delayed due to flood it\\'s acceptable..products was safe due to plastic coating by lenovo. 5star to them because of them product was safe not because of amazonrating 1star for amazon. and 5star for lenovo cast function not working. i called to customer care they asked me that i have to purchase one cast modem for functioning cast option.i really felt disappointed.battery draining problem.mobile heating.bad product. don\\'t purchase wtf mobile.. mobile is good but charging issue.. 0 star not is option so 1. star using for 7 months. working well till now. good quality with reasonable price very bad performance..there r too many problems like charging, hitting , and slow processing. plz return my set. taking very long time to charge nearly 7 hrs to charge good mobile awesome phone amazing i love lenovo smartphone very nice phone as shown in picture very nice clearity of pics amazon and lenovo is cheating with us..#phone is not volte and only one sim card can be set as 4g..so it\\'s not 4g+4g dual standby..#notification light is not working for missed calls even when set for all..#fingureprint sensor is not able lock device..working only for unlocking and taking pictures..#no use of dual camera..it is worst..not able to produce detailing in photos also at high resolution mode..#gets hot quickly in few minutes of gaming..but m luck that there is no battery issue.. value for money!!! excellent product in this price battery problem. full charge in 5 hours and doun speedly don\\'t buy this set if you want cast screen. it is extremely heating. facing lots of problem related to battery.not getting charged fast . nice phone, video calling is very clear, network problem is very less as the processor is very good. can buy... worth of money. nice lenovo very good absolutely fine.. good and on time delivery very good items its very good product with latest technology but compared with mi note 4 some heating issue after using net. battery is almost good. i recommend to buy this. because you got extra sd slot with 2 sim good product, good quality. bad just some heating issue otherwise this mobile is perfect in this range it\\'s camera is not good. there is no auto focus . plus selfies gets very sharp nd looks very bad. also pixels get distorted . ur hd video\\'s colours will get distorted . everything is great but good camera is a major need nowadays . i seriuosly don\\'t want to return this product but i need better camera phone. low cost n high definition camera n good product battery draining too fast.... ok my opinion is don\\'t buy this mobile...mobile call recording this basic feature and others operating issues... and after system updates company completely failed to provide call recording function, and call recording application not working it\\'s really good product from lenova, i like it. two màin issues1. phone main camera is very poor2. heating of phone nice product i want to return my device but amazon sent it\\'s employee and that employee didn\\'t solve my problem but amazon not return this device..so i had to go to service centre for solve out defect in my lenovo k8 note. in this process my lot of time wasted and i faced mentally pressure also. good not as expected. camera specifications seemed so good. but it\\'s to poor. bad buy.. even touch feel is not great. nice phone but camera average bakwas phone phone looks good performs finehowever i cant transfer any music files,videos in the phone memory from pc it shows empty.help?? very happy with the product i hate amazone amazone se kuch vi matt lena...agar letea hai to refund nhi hoga ye jan le... heating and battery problem.battery drain fastly it\\'s nice awesome product... superb clarity... bought for a good price the interface and the gaming performances were very good but my unit drained battery faster, and i don\\'t know about other purchases.both front and rear cameras are very average and not even close to my moto g4+.audio via loudspeaker is really nice but the earpiece sucks.finally a weird problem. i couldn\\'t make calls when the mobile was on batter saver mode.i have requested a return and it has been processed, a refund has been initiated. most likely will buy a redmi note 4 or a lenovo p2. poor camera 📷, problem in voice calling and not good as i expected.if you are planning for this, don\\'t. i was using lumia 730 and wanted to switch to an android phone at last.i chose this phone based on the hype and the specs it comes with.overall the phone is good but i felt whatever was promised on it\\'s ad by lenovo wasn\\'t there in real. the phone is laggy even in normal usage quite a few times despite the hype of it 10 core processor. not good for high end games i mean i use normal games like 8ball pool and this phone couldn\\'t even run that game smoothly and felt glitches and lags every time during the gameplay and spoiled the experience of it. my iphone 4s plays better 8ball pool better then this phone.being a normal user i ignored it and now let\\'s talk about the camera. the shutter speed of clicking the pictures is the worst i have seen and the quality of pictures isnt that great, it felt like a high end vga camera and the panorama pictures are the worst - worst.i don\\'t know what the youtube reviewers saw in it for their biased reviews.2 stars from my side for it. i\\'m not seate fid is lenovo k8 note nice mobile at this price ... good camera clearity.. dolby music experience is awsm.... cost worthy. good battery backup. camera quality good during day time and poor at night. major disadvantage is notification led is not glowing for 3rd party applications such as whatsapp, messanger, hike... since its the known issue till the product release, there is no fix found for this, that is the only saddest part about this product. heating issue is there after continues usage.. photo clarity is average.. battery too is not up to the mark but still manageable.. dont buy! very bad headset.worst quality. very heating and hanging. super product k8 note ,🤗 it\\'s good but heating of the handset is the only drawback of the product. camera is good. as on date its get updated to oreo but the heating of is still there. thinking to go to the service centre for needful action by them good smartphone mobile performance 4stars.battery 2stars.camera 3stars.rating 3 stars. incredible phone. camera is awesome and phone is superfast camera is not goodheating issuelenova dont buy in whole life this is followed second devise k3 note also suck and this device k8 note also suckdont buydon\\'t waste moneynonrefundable excellent mobile phone from lenovo...thanks to lenovo,don\\'t confuse to buy just buy you will definitely satisfied with this mobile. display problem no headphones with this 📱. very astonishing. it is not for those are just buying for dual camera and battery for full day usage because in some cases the battery is becoming so warm which sometimes causes a blast, and the most important thing is that the camera cannot focuses the object properly kachra dual camera 3 stars for the processor, selfie camera, good looking design and no need of other two.. . i seem to have a problem with video playback on the device. i need to restart the mobile phone every second for videos to actually play on the device. don\\'t purchase lenovo phone. too many software issue which they don\\'t resolve. good product . i love this good mobile overall a sooperb machine...but heating is a huge problem. very good awesome mobile waste item, over heating top and best phone ever depth mode for camera accha nehi hai.duel camera setup ka koi value nahi hai.battery

mobile lenovo k8 note heating problem in this mobile phone not working properly...signal issue this product is too costly for this price range it should have been priced under 10000, no one shall order this product. great performance, good camera, good battery and good looks. it could have been a great mobile but lacks few features like screen cast (only through chromecast), camera can be improved for low light, memory and power could be better. fir the price point it is definitely a great mobile phone. lenovo should keep working on it to make it a game changer. heating problemheat

getting detected in my pc while hot spot of other mobile\\'s get detected.4. outgoing / incoming voice issues is coming several timeswhen i bought i read that i have 6 month battery and one year replacement warranty but now that option is not shown in amazon kindly help me to get the replacement for the product issue in microphone and no heaphones work while calling fantastic mobile.. mast mobile iska camera to super excellent perfomence.good camera,no hanging no heat.overall best mobile for this price. i am writing this review after using almost 10 months. before i was using moto g2 which was good but became old and slow overtime. then i wanted to buy better phone with good camera. the specs of lenovo k8 note tempted me to buy mainly duel camera and fast charging. i was expecting better camera phone but disappointed a bit and could not achieve my goal :( overall phone rating is average. defective product provided by amazon i am posting this review after a week of usage.first of all lots of people problem is to go with this one or redmi note 4 . so i have used both the device . the only difference between this one and rn4 is battery backup . you\\'ll get around 8 hours of sot in rn4 but only around 5 to 6 hours in k8 note.other than that all the aspects are definitely better in k8 note. and there is also fast charging in this one which charges fully in 2 hours without using the device if you are using then definitely charging will be much slower.if we consider k8 note alonepros aredual camera (if only there is an update in future to improve)fast chargingdisplay (all mobiles in this price segment maybe fhd. but this one is slightly better)dolby atmosstock android superb fluidity (definitely lenovo done a great job by removing their ui and goes with stock)theatre max ( if u are person who is watching lots of hollywood movies this is best feature)cons arei experiencing heating issue while charging and playing (but not too much i think it\\'s manageable)difference in battery backup ( sometimes i\\'m getting 6 hours of sot and sometimes around 4 to 5 hours ..but i suggest you to install greenify for more better battery backup)unwanted second camera if there is no further updates for camerathose are the cons i found till nowfinally there are the problems like camera and battery but those can be solved via ota so i am eagerly waiting for updates.for 14k i\\'ll definitely suggest this one over rn4 , moto g5 plus and honor 6x.im disappointed now that is more than a month no proper update for camera and battery backup is getting worse...so i suggest u guys to ignore this one fantastic.... very good phone but heats when charging. lenovo k8 is a excellent phone within this budget. excellent...very very nice product. worst warrenty in service centre .........damaged in 3 months itself...paid 1600 afterwards to repair this mobile ...heating issues and bad batterry life great super handset awesome experience. good mobile in the range good everything is nice just disappointed from the interface, also the led notification light only works for text messages battery jyada nahi chalti hai yr. aur kbhi kbhi charging mai 3 hr tk le leti hai. great phone with this prise range.value for money.go for it without any thinking this phone is up to a mark but camera at nite its not soo gud but at day time its clear and if i say about batery backup if i use data it last 6-7 hour hardley and if i dnt use data it will go easily more than a day but according to price phone is gud 6month emi not converted. very poor product . the battery charging is not working properly , it takes more than 8 hours to charge the mobile 100%. i think this is a defective piece. dust get inside in the camera lens from a fine hole that is located on the top of the camera. camera quality is not that good. camera not bad bt not great not as expectedheating upbattery drains fastcamera is okno call recorderno screenshot shortcutno gallery app..i didn\\'t liked at all... one day delivery 12k only 2t offer 2.3/2.0/1.5/ deca core processors very fast . call recording naki audio super itisnot enough loud .video and camera super.display and screen also morveles good investment. nice product i can\\'t cast/ mirroring to my smart tvand also there is no app lock plese refund or replace my mobile lenovo vibe k8 note its problem atomic swich off many more times plese replace its fantastic model and back up of the battery also good,and charger also best one.. super phone exlent phone left speaker is not working .is it working ?? in. this smartphone same mistake so u don\\'t perched this smartphone getting overheat during calls over 10 minutes. not able to return the item. plesae do not buy. so nice phone nice mobile k8note camera is very disappointing and after updating to latest versions front camera loses the quality and music out was very poor as compared to k3note, k4 note and there is an option for slow motion video which is the worst feature in this phone i got the perfect mobile today, very smooth and fast screen touch, good betry backup , easy to handle also in smart look. very nice value of money this smartphone is awesome. i\\'m using it. it works really good. just awesome, just awwwesome gud phone at good price but mera cash back to bhejo nice phone but camera not as good as described. voice let not working properly incoming call not come in volet (jio sim). volte is working as lte not as volte but while mobile is in off more than 10 minits the jio sim is in off also not receiving incoming call and the jio sim will be working after the mobile put on. hence lenovo has to rectify this immediately. features that provided are not working well. good feature and working well till date really it\\'s worst phone i bought this phone 2 months back. omg it\\'s irritating. if we restart our lenovo k8note it will take more time. heating prob very high . phne signal network also worst. camera little bit better. no phone call recording option. i can\\'t expect this type of phone from lenovo. my rating is 0 out of 5. charging wire damage and lenovo k8 note one speaker on second speaker not working good value for money. -turbo charging is awesome phone fully charged in 99 mins-best mid range phone with 10-core processor-better than redmi note 4-good phone for normal daily useage heating issues. your phone start heating after some days of usage. also, there is some awkward behavior of the phone. application starts automatically even though have shut off sensers and some of the applications. mi max2 is far better choice than this one. ok.not bad but call recording not possible for this mobile charging problem good the phone was working well for first one month,only camera was somewhat low quality.later the phone stopped getting proprly charged. charging now takes upto 7 hrs.battery dies fast. my cousin had same phone and same problem as well. i love the features of this mobile but battery capacity is not as expected best product and good quality price range very high .. 13999.. big billion day price 11999body , design very cheap complete plastic feel like 8 8000 price phone , heating issue face , camera quality low , .. only great 4gb ram , 64 gb storage , 10 octcore process .. other wise this mobile correct price 9000 to 10000 max good awesome phone nice user interface. nice product.good battery life the product rates are slashed within 2days for rs.1000. its very bad. lenovo k8 note is an amazing mobile. in 12k-14k this is the best phone.thank you amazon. is very bad phone . don\\'t purchase it camera is not good it\\'s not a very good phone many times hanging problems and startup time is very much such a awesome smartphone in cheaper price there is very serious network related issues in reliance jio at every loactions which was not in mi note 4 . i called jio customer service centre but they told me that your phone is not listed in our data .dual camera is not upto the markbattery drains very fast.kindly fix netwrk related issue in next update and camera experiencebut overall phone is good. headphone r not supplied as prescribed in the description nice phone with great configuration under this budget.. go ahead features of this phone r amazing. i loved it\\'s clarity too. i bought 3 phones through amazon.inbut right now i m suffering a lot by buying lenovo k8 note (venom black). it bocmes too hot while talking as well as charging. it takes 6-7 hours to charge atleast 50-60%.please do the needful.i hope you will take necessary steps soon and support your good customers.thanks go for buy 10-12 days good back of battery but now only 6-8 hrs. also call to care for same but no any solution. don\\'t purchase this phn good phone in such a lowest price this lenovo product is just worst and bogus product being cheap.-no ui support. so many features are missing.-no gallery. no option to store contacts in device memory. for all you have to use google\\'s photos, google\\'s contacts, which may not be safe.-sys update is available. but when you first try to update, it update and update and update for so many times (not data speed issue) for various versions of update.-so called 13+5mp dual back camera and 13mp front facing camera are useless!-the so called 4000mah battery does not lasts longer with very normal usage. no videos games etc. who has opened the non-removable and seen whether it is a 4000mah.never buy this mobile phone. such a useless phone with hell no. of useless in-built appthe phone heats too much even after installing so many software updates delay delivery service...camera quality is not good..depth mode is not working properly..guys plzzzz don\\'t purchase this mobile..nothing special in this phone.camera - ok and quality less than any mi basic camerabattery - it drain as fast as furious.heating - like you sit on a gas burner. avg phone tempature is between 45\\' to 40\\', when ask company for the same they said it\\'s normal according to standards it should not go above 48 degree. but you all customer can amazon holding a phone on 44 degree next to your ear is hazardous to health.performance - whatsapp, icicibank , hangout aap keep on giving automatic stop error message have send multiple report to lenovo team but no response yet.note: lesson learned never buy anyphone in first sale. screen cast option not available bst product and super lenovo product my fevret product lenovo i purchased this phone recently. the phone having the good camera quality and also provides very good photo features. however, it is having bluetooth related issues. i connected this phone to my car via bluetooth and observed the bluetooth connectivity. the bluetooth was getting disconnected continuously while listening to music as well as during phone calls. overall is good phone is awesome... work\\'s very smoothly....but it takes time to boot..... both cameras are perfect... in 14k its mind blowing..... performance of the phone doesn\\'t match the product description.do not waste your money on this and customer service is also as bad as they phone and they perfectly match each other and didn\\'t take my complaint or issue even after receiving the product nice phone worst product.. worst battery, heavy, everything is worst it\\'s cool but it\\'s sound out put is not good so i\\'m rating 4 stars it\\'s going good its really very bad product don\\'t purchase it.. good phone good phone very good phone... i love it. but manufacturing defects are arise. worth for the prie hmmm battery backup is not good very bad product i never buy again this product great value for money phone. super cons1. camera is protruding and is getting scratches even after using cheap plastic cover provided with the set.2. metal body is very slippery.3. my k4 note delivered better sound than new k8.4. camera fails to identify subject in depth mode, making it very difficult to use the depth features.5. lots of features of on screen display r not present making less informative.6. heavyin about 10 days of use i and feeling a little disappointed to choose this model. previously it was a good phone for multipurpose use. but after new software update everything has become worse.main issue- battery drain, full of bugs, many apps not working properly, picture quality become dull, performance become blunt. nice best one very good most importantly battery backup is less than mi note 3..but as lenovo commitment about battery backup is totally wrong.... pic quality also not much better..even mi note 4 better in overall view....only one factor is good it\\'s dolby sounds.. bad camera the dual cam does not work properly,it doesn\\'t make the background blurry , background changes in a good way there are multiple issues with this lenovo k8 model . it is even matching the performance of previous lenovo phone models.1, sim slot 1 is does not have 4g support.2, even if i stand under a open parking slot or some shady area , phone does not catch he 4g coverage that also in bangalore main city locations.3, battery does not even run for one complete day , even though they claiming high ma battery on it.4, phone get heat even we speak for 3 min .i am totally unsatisfied with this phone model and really thinking for throwing away because of poor antenna and network coverage issues . nice mobile with original android software...batter than redmi note 4. don\\'t buy it ... my friendly suggestions to you ...wrost battery backupscamera not satisfiedhangs sometimesheating is biggest issue not entrested nice mobile with all functions as described best product very good phone good for music lovers . but bluetooth connectivity is very poor. need to think before you buy . product is good but only camera is below average.don\\'t buy.see for others if u need a good camera.go for samsung or moto g5 plus. this is the third time i got refurbished mobile under the label of new item. very cheap and worst people to do these kind of things. mobile is awesome..... awesome camera quality.. very high performance.. excellent very problematic phone......does heating ishue i am posting this review after 3 months of usage.initially the phone looked good, but as i started using i found many problems.1. if you go to contacts and click on any contact the screen goes blank and you cant open the contact.2. mirroring function is not there, so if you want to do mirroring on your tv or projector its not possible3. bluetooth doesnt work, the phone is not searchable by any other bluetooth device or it cant search any active bluetooth device4. camara is ok nothing great to have duar camara at the back, and front camara has average result.5. charging takes long time in some sockets, dont know why.6. front sensorts are not that great.my overall verdict is if you can get a better option at this price then go for it. the phone\\'s primary camera is poor, after the snap is clicked the photos look dull, the phone does not come with call recording feature inbuilt as well as third party app only records self voice. the phone is not worth the price is neither comparable to redmi note 4 battery is very vest very good product battery backup is very good nice looking smooth touch only camera quality and sound quality not up to the mark ,specially the sound quality is very poor ,k5 note sound quality is far better than k8 note sound quality the best specs in its category with the best available price. 2nd consecutive lenovo brand purchase for self use. reliable brand. very poor material this divas is very bed and most hit heating problem nice one in my opinion the device is great then other devices but battery is not working like 4000mah. super good phone but camera isnt too good so better go for new phones k8 is old already pros:good display, speaker, battery life,camera.split screen is interesting but several apps are not supported on it.cons: no earphones in the box. turbo charger takes up to 45 mins to fully charge the phone as opposed to advertised 15 mins.good for users who are looking for budget phones with good camera and using it for organising their work etc.the lack of earphones makes it not so enjoyable for watching movies , videos- inspite of a good display. not worth of it\\'s money don\\'t buy. this phone has heating issue. try ur luck if u want and may be this works good for u. amazon return policy is very bad for mobile device. once u complain for defective product, they will block ur number and u won\\'t be able to call them again for replacement or refund. u will have to write mails for which no revert will come. in return option they will ask to install an app which will always tell that ur phone is ok. my sincere suggestion is that don\\'t buy from amazon any mobile device. i appreciate flipkart or snapdel as they return without any question if ur product is not good. my phone touches 40degree when i start taking and they since the temperature is less than 48 it\\'s ok for use. nonsense. nice phone perfect good product ,nice respond by amazon i\\'m using lenovo k8 note ..in this mobile simple options are missing like data speed meter , night mode,virus scanner . nowadays every mobiles they are adding this features but this is newly launched smartphone but this specifications are missing overheating and the turbocharge doesnot supportit takes long time to charge upto 3 hours very decent phone in this price range. so nice product.just go for it.. i returned the product,battery issue speaker is average...you can not select ring tone...two negative points.... camera is fine 1 star because of camera quality n no call recording option....pachta raha hun yeh phone kharid k.. improve bluetooth connection too.. it\\'s too bad while playing music with bluetooth speaker.. good phone but there is heating issue and battery is draining to fast kindly provide some power saver setting in latest update bad ui. no gallery, becomes very hot while using (normal usage) net, battery backup is very bad. model is very big compare to screen, overall very bad experience....don\\'t go for this totally waste of money battery drain very very fast. camera is very very bad quality.phone is anytime heat when open camera,when charging,when using net.heating problem is very big problem for this phonelenovo is cheating for this productthis phone is not worth a single reviewi return thismy lines is absolutely true.i\\'m not saying fakeplease please ......don\\'t buy this product wrost phone ever.. good but camera quality is not good i want to change this mobile phone..lenovo is saying this is a fast charging phone.but it is taking 1 houre for 20% battry charging.plzzzz help me out of this over heading, camera poor, prosser slow battery backup is not good and the contact search option is very bad it search the first numbers only not the last 5 numbers and not searched in the call history it searches only in saved contacts awesome , camera,sound,all things best. poooor battery...compare to first 10 days.it takes 3 to 4 hours to full charging.battery drains so quickly.more heating problem. i bought this mobileit\\'s get very heat in small use of this mobile best mobile phone this price segment .. i like it. good i like you auto call not support & battery survice not longlisting. battery service only one day but oreo virsion is very good awesome phone....good display. camera is good...no heating issues. good build quality.overall phone is good please don\\'t parches lenovo k8 not bettry so very low process also bad nice phone in this price this mobile is very good but mobile is heating more but still it is very good little bit heavy. response time should improve super product speaker sound lowdolby not working phone is not so good and not satisfied. i found that in low light, pics are very bad. do not go by mega pixels and dual camera with front selfie flash etc. camera and pic quality is very bad. phone battery becomes warm when you charge and it took 2hrs to charge 80%. i don\\'t know what they mean by turbo charging if it takes 2hrs. also while browsing, battery becomes warm.. display is not catchy and look average mobilemlgood thing is that it\\'s latest android version mobile, and look wise good. still haven\\'t explored much on processor speed. overall disappointed with mobile.amazon packing was bad. they have packed with no puffing. i don\\'t know how they do this. very bad. nice camera is not good for portrait mode good product value for money good very good product easy to handle for honest review don\\'t buy it takes too much time for startup when the device js switched offcameras ok not that much well and the main reason to buy it was the dual camera portait mode but clearly it fails to provide good potrait mode pics phone cant shoot 4k video, but can shoot if lenovo upgrade software??? pls reply good smartphones and battery life is also good quite good for the price point don\\'t update system software to oreo 8.0.0, till update my phone is working fine, after that it start hanging, specially finger sensor don\\'t work. i am not able to receive a call or open my phone at the time of need, gud phone as compared to it\\'s range all phones it\\'s camera and

bad vi mera lenovo k8 note screch ho gaya and rear camera me glass ke under dust chala gaya . return this product and give me another my product in warranty period a good looking and good performing mobile. can\\'t say about battery backup, but usage on daily basis like calls, wi-fi, youtube and 1-2 he gaming it gives one day backup .4 stars because it\\'s a heavy phone. amazon i didn\\'t got my 10% cash back yet. stock android avoids unnecessary bloatware softwares.performance efficient mobile at this price range.runs on android nougat good phone was fine but there is a scratch mark on the bottom of the phone.but over all performance is excellent.thanks for introducing a great product. the best smartphone you can opt for with comparison to all the latest smartphones in market. i bought this phone on first sell...after using 10days almost ...today i\\'m facing some issue like ... draining of battery .....phn is automatically shut down...and bit heating issue too...camera features is not so good specially dual camera ...that dslr feature of blur not working at all...so i suggest you to go with some other brand rather to lenovo... excellent product among other competitive mobiles with new updates & 64 bit deca core p helio 10 mediatek processor.support quick charging also. excilent phone phone features absolutely amazing...only heating issue... loved it big screen poor battery only 2900 mah good at this price, but some features are missing in this, if in future clears these with an update then it will be too good. gallery app removed, cant lock apps with finger print. depth camera will not work properly in dark. not getting option to lock pictures and apps nice phone heating and not charging well. hanging network is not good, sim 2 is not working properly. always says the user is out of network which is irritating. i am returning this product.lenovo k8 note (venom black, 4gb) worse and worst good product but there is a few drawback voice recoding not available , according to mentioned feature the camera\\'s are not work properly. screen cast won\\'t work in this model, if anybody in this feature then don\\'t go for it. and customized screen shot option also not available in this unlike k5 note. and lot of other things are just like any other mobile. and finally as lenovo said it\\'s not a killer performing phone. nice all is well but battery backup is not good as it should be cause of it\\'s 4000 mah battery. excellent this beast will take us to the next generation/world/planet.... a hot cake phone with amazing camera, battery, sound and what not... i am just loving it...this phone aka beast is breathtaking.. thank you lenovo...!! bad :-too heavy.... no design..... memory card hard to use first u have to format it then only it can work with this phone...no gallery app, u have to install....no easy phone.....4000 mah battery is not upto the mark...good :-camera is good not best.... internal memory is good....front camera with flash.... works two sim with memory card.... finger sensor.....touch is good... screen size is good... lenovo k8 note - if i compare with mi mobile below features not found.1) sms - you can\\'t select multiple messages for deletion at one go. talking about the conversion between you and other person.2) can\\'t add contact of a person via sms, if you want to sent a person contact to b person.3) no inbuild gallery of lenovo4) inbuild file manager is hopeless. you can\\'t copy paste.5) screenshot option not available in mobile. you have to press down volume button and power button.6) speaker quality is good as it has dolby as compare to mi mobiles.8) not able to select comfortably other person in conference.9) not able to select multiple people if need to send same message to many7) not a user friendly mobile. all good but hitting issue is the problem. nice phone. but some app. like gallery r not shown on display. but shown only on watsapp. overall gud phone. bad experience, battery decharging quickly and it takes too much time to charge phones are getting slimmer but bend are not covered in warrenty.after using the phone for 4 months a huge bend occur in the handset but service center saying bend problem is not covered in warrenty hence cannot help.so my question is for lenovo why company is making thinner mobiles with big screen if customer are facing this type of problem and if company will continue doing so the bend problem should also covered in warrenty.bad experiance.more over my vol. - button stoped working and after rushing to service center i come to know that it get broken and service center denied to replace the same in warrenty and giving bull shit reason that its damage hence not covered in warrenty.so my question is what is covered in warrenty?i could have give .5 stars if option available.think 1000 times before buying lenovo product because there was lots of people like me struglling to get their mobiles repaired under warrenty. awesome phone... reasonable and effective. i alwaz recommend this product. huge network issue with this model dont look for hardware but software version used by lenovo on this k8 note model is worst. this software has lack basic functionalities like theme and other basic features you can find in samsung. even cast option is not working. defect in the latest operating system. no change in handling this mobile even k4 note is better than k8 note. i have upgraded this mobile to latest nogut os version 7.1.1 but no help and future version 8.0 oreio will available in next diwali 2018. so there is no effort by lenovo. worst quality product by lenovo. better to go for samsung performance not as expected. lots of bugs for blutooth. many times hangs while playing games. less frequent updates. screen burning is another issue. dont buy this phone from amazon.after purchaseing a lot of problem occured like battery back up too weak,heating issue not solved and headphone not support.i had mailed on amazon with service report card but no helpful reply from them.they do not return/replace this item.too much worst experience from amazon.never purchase electronic items like mobile or tablet from amazon. good battery performance. delivers a full day of duty for a relatively high usage of mail box, net usage, and social surfing. response of the os and equipment is in line with the expectation. speakers are good. after the stunning results i get on my motoz, it is only natural that i do. it find the results of the camera in line with my expectation ! overall, a fantastic value for money ! superb...... phone par vaat karta speaker fate (brock) that che good battery back up and works as expected very handy and upto date phone but nfc option is not there otherwise best phone in 2017 outstanding look, very fast touch, long lasting battery and every device is connected , capacity very high and many more function . just try it... display not working properly even before one year break the display nice phone thank amazon it was mentioned in the reviews that this product has turbo charging.. but this charger seems to be the slowest charger i have ever seen.. dual camera doesn\\'t seem to be working as the other phones with dual camera works this phone has lots of space..but it heats due to mediatek processor.. poor camera result.not much user friendly... good great phone for the price we are paying..! even heating problems also seems to solved and selfi\\'s are also great..! phone was delivered almost on time as committed. i found it to be good and value for money product. slight heating& battery capacity is not perfect,,and the system update will not work ,,,it will notify anad i also proseed to update,,,but no changes occur,,,,worst on system update,,,give me clear answer on system update it\\'s really good hardly use of 30 mins n the phone gets hot, battery don\\'t last long on full charge, even though it\\'s 4000 mah. alarm does not work, when phone is shut off. using mi4a also, much better phone. heating problem battery back up poor takes 8 hrs to get charge third class product don\\'t waste money it\\'s one of the best smartphone but due to mediatek processor it gets over heated when in use for long or playing any high end games..... like pubg.....i wished lenovo may have used a powerful qualcomm snapdragon processor...... good phone in best price worst product ever. battery is draining out and camera is not upto mark. amazon is cheating here. trying to return the product but not giving option. bye bye amazonplease don\\'t buy any phone from amazon. delivery is faster but once you get the phone no one is going to listen you gorilla glass broke when i went for replace mentioned they are asking 70% of the mobile cost. battery is very bead its extremely grateful and works very nice 1.heating issue2.average battery love it.good battery backup.performance good. my lenovo k8 note charging slow it takes 6to8 hours for 100% charging heating super best there is no earphone as mention in accessories. it is quite sade. otherwise the phone is excellent. mobile bill available today face the problem charging not working properly i have go to service station in rajkot. service station employee talk to product service warranty not issue to dealer & distributor in rajkot very good charging not so fast after update the software. battery drain fast. overall it\\'s good just awsome..mainly the camera and processor..plz go fr it after all it\\'s best mobile under 15 k but in camera section it\\'s blur feature not work every time not that great as was presented on a launch date of 09/08/2017 the killer they were saying rather than focusing on specs company should focus more on the quality. awesome phone ... everything is quite good god one it\\'s good for money, awesome mobile good one for the price and worth too. android noughat misses some features of the earlier versions. so a bit hard to you get customized the looks and other things. otherwise good. seller packed it nicely. prompt and exact. 100% for the seller. thanks amazon. nice .... not like edited. the phone has i think has no gorilla glass, because it did not survive a fall from the hand. glass broke. therefore i reduced the rating. lpoor battery, last for only a day without much activity too. phone has hanged twice up till now. messages also get mixed up, you click on one and it shows you another, this aso happened twice. k4 is far better. read my k4 review were i have given 5 stars. this phone is poor battery is not gooddischarge fast got it broken when hit the door nice phone for this price and better than others phones above this price also.there is no issue about the battery and camera also works very good. this was a goood mobile and cam clarity was awsome ........ but the only problem heat.....which is more only while charging other than this its spr i purchaseded this phone in october 2017, it\\'s working properly. super phone 😀 it\\'s a average quality phone . don\\'t buy this with price 14000/-bluetooth and shareit connectivity problem occur in my device.after restore factory,software reset and update software the problem is same it could not rectify. 1 no speaker is working from first day of purchase.camara quality is too poor. no suggestions to purchase this product. it takes too much time to switch on, otherwise it is a good phone. this 1 star is for the delivery. i had very bad experience with delivery person. for lenovo k8 note i\\'ll give 5 star, it is good looking as well having all recent features with additional music key as a shortcut. very good phone within this price range. vibrant look, user friendly, faster interface etc. don\\'t buy because heats too much amazon not provide the right detail about this phone that it is not a volte phone. this phone is not a volte phone only lte supportconnectivity/radiosdata: gprs, edge, hspa+, ltespeed: lte 150 mbps (dl) / 50 mpbs (ul) cat44g network: fdd lte band 1/3/5/7/8/ | tdd lte band 403g network: wcdma band 1/5/82g network: gsm band 2/3/5/8and when you connect hand-free to this phone the hand-free icon is not show about the processor not good it little hang not good. it is good,but needs to improve user\\'s friendly. battery is a big issue, although is has 4000 mh,but drain out by evening. handling very easy but mobile is heating camera is pathetic and sub standard. best for me overall a good product.camera and sound is better than almost all the rs. 20,000 phones, processor performance is good, oreo will soon be made available.there is some issue with brightness, hope it\\'s resolved in next update. call recording app not working, messages, whatsapp and missed call not shown on icons, overall an average product. battery is good. after 2 month use found some problems1. brightness shaken like some time gets low and high (not running under auto brightness)2. during calls sometimes screen not locked other functions are getting clicked.3. bockeh effect is not good as expected . can not judge the subject. get bulr the subject also.4. heating problem is there while using bluetooth and internet simultaneously.5. no gallary other playstore gallery\\'s are too good.6. not a gaming phone sometimes hangs.7. hanging issues while starting and running applications also. cannot do anything because battery is fixed non removable.8. many functions not working like screen casting cannot detect my smart tv and usb cable not detected in pc.9. automatic voice call recorder not works in this phone . only one app works which is paid rs. 650.overall 3 stars as per price and fuctions good experience overall featured of your phone is owesome...but headphone is not availble with this product. very good phone heating is a bit problem but is fast gud worst phone, phone is not getting charge just after 2 days and battery draining so fast...heating issue as well. it\\'s an average phone..better to go for moto g plus...rather then this...not satisfied packing is good but the content makes us feel as secondhand because the mobile supplied by suchitra electronics ,hyderabad when taken out from pack and switched on has 60% charge, had back cover (plastic), bluetooth is on and some downloaded apps shown. so very cheating activity is doubted. very good smartphonegreat looking very good performance everything is good phone is ok...but battery charging time from 0 to 100 is not less than 2 hours. it takes more than 2 hours.dual camera feature need to be improved and phone battery doesn\\'t last for the whole day.waiting for an update for :1. better battery life2. lesser charging time3. improved camera\\'s charger not working properly it takes 8 hours to full charge mobile . battery backup very bad very cheap security given no app lock, when you on hotspot how many person connected to your hotspot doesn\\'t display even which person you wants to block is also not displaying and other things are good but it\\'s security level isn\\'t good. its heating like hell. don\\'t buy it. lenovo should need improvement. hanging issues. camera is like i\\'m using mp camera. battery draining fast. i loved previous lenovo\\'s k4 note phone before but now they changed their product\\'s quality. also their service centre\\'s staff are not professional. they don\\'t have even basic knowledge about possible issues in phones and they compare service with samsung and iphone. lol.. best in camera how it is connected with pc good mobile...nice camera worth to buy i m use this phone is very good handling&performance camera quality is also good i\\'ve been using the mobile for 8 days now and it\\'s better in every way. the only issue i felt so far is that it switched off all by itself twice in this mean time. that too after charging it full. hope this will be rectified in the next software update. thank you!! phone is awesome but one speaker is not working.... second time i get disappointed .. suppppeeerrrr warking slow very good phone with balanced features.i.e camera,sound with dolby . bokka product.....worst ever nice phone with almost all features . good easy to use and featured most satisfied with phone and camera is superb nice battery not good mobile phone is hiting issue and mobile restarting problem display is duplicate products results is very poor mobile is not return policy not shopping this item media chaina products and mobile hitting problem gallery not available. the android build has too many problems. bluetooth for one is highly unreliable. second, battery life is quite erratic. do not buy and download the oreo build as it will destroy the phone. bad display quality and bad sound sestem. very very poor net work. great phone! good features and battery. i liked the back camera with the bokeh effectthe front camera, although clear is not very bright.but apart from that its a really good phone in this price range. dont go for this mobile and very poor product from amazon..........sms are not going, heating camera quality is poor happy so far using since two week, i am heavy user better not work whole day my wifi on all time i bought k8 note on 18 august. every thing good .. but battery discharges quickly. charging is also not a turbo charging .. even the phone is used by power saving battery mode does not give good battery backup . dafault call recording facility not provided . screen resolution is good . if you trust its battery you will be humiliated. better carry power bank for extra safety . awesome mobile with good battery back up and beautiful dual camera. after 3 months of usage i find it very good phone. long battery backup, crisp picture quality, bright display, more than enough memory, vast storage, clear voice on call and media and good network connectivity.. one can definitely go for it. i bought this phone on 1st flash sale on amazon. after using for about 20 days battery got crashed within 24 hours. when i submitted this phone to lenovo service centre they assured me that it will get repaired within 5 days. after submission they found that the mother board is also crashed and need replacement. i thought it can occur in any gadget like this. but , its almost 2 weeks now they unable to replace it. unable to explain cause of delay. the lenovo company cheated in terms of quality and customer service. awesome phone pros :1. display2. dolby atmos3. camera in daylight4. pure android5. games are played with ease, feels bit warm but managable6. selfie cameracons:1. 🔋does not look like 4100 mah2. camera - depth mode is sham3. oleophobic coating is sham4. screen to body ratio best phone in its range.front camera is very good. touch screen is amazing but it doesnt support volte as i am using jio sim. waste mobile.dont go for it.i went to service centre 5 times after buying this. there is no smart tv mirror option.. very bad experience..i am now feeling myself made a biggest mistake of buying lenovo mobile.. i will get damage pice plz exchange it give new phone waste product ever f..... off amazon phone is good but camera result is average not safisfied with photos even day lightamazon returns policy is very bedfrom onother app like flipkart and paytm is very good returns policy this is very bad mobile, because overheat , hanging etc , please don\\'t buy any lenovo mobile, my experience with lenove mobile is very 2 poor well was very excited to buy it. . but after oreo update there is a decrease in the battery backup. i am hoping it will get corrected by the developers soon. overall the camera performance is average charging time is approx 2 hrs and sometimes heats ....average phone... better option available in market at even low price range ... this mobile is incredible with great features. it has dual flash with great clearity .auto face detection..excellent battery life ....by mahesh m. awesome phone everything is very good in this phone . loved it . this is not good phone as compared to lenovo vibe k5 note which i was using before. vibe k5 note is the best phone instead of this. i am completely disappointed to purchase this phone with exchange of my previous k5 note. nice mobile best phone with this price . don\\'t go for negative reviews it was really nice . am satisfied with this phone . 👍 not worth the money. there is heating problem and phone lags. the

by amazon..i purchased phone on 1 sep in flash sale.battery drains without using it.i chraged baterry witv100% in night &switc hed on in morning 15 % less battery showing without use battery drains worst camera result,no gallry optin avilable at all.n battery indicator nt showing hw much battery left.camera it the worst part of phone 13 mp is nt gvn as told result is like 8mp vry bad result.lenovo & amazon loot the people by doing flash sale as this product cant be sold in market directly bcoz of quality issue.the product they can sell in market sell with the help of online shopping like amazon bt comany loot the peoples money by flash sale.i want to retun it but no body listen at amazon customer care.very rude staff.dont buy anything from amazon the dont accept returns if product is faulty then also..they only need our money to support china.please dntbbuy this mobile i\\'ll not give more than one rating because heating issues in this mobile and even camera is also not good i had bought the product in 29sept pls send the invoice for the sameas it is not working now its good but some time lag when play in bluetooth the phone is great. battery life is also awesome.pricing is high for this product, as redmi 5 pro is higher quality in same price band. niceeeee phone not very impressed with the phone, it lacks so many settings and options. for example:1) it does not show the devices connected to it when hotspot is turned on2) there is no option on the pull up/pull down menus to control vibration/ringing, you have to use the volume button to mute the ringer3) you cant change the lock screen wall paper4) one has to tap twice to open up a link on the page (when browser is used)5) since the speaker is at the bottom of the phone, when you put a call on speaker, the experience is very annoying6) does not have black screen smart gestures7) it is extremely heavy too.its supposed to be the 8th update of the knote series by lenovo, but functionality wise it seems to be such a basic phone..although the phone does not lag and charging is pretty quick.. brand new phone purchased. received on 28th august, 2017. and there are lots of issues with this phone on the first day itself.* not getting charged.* bluetooth not working,* wifi not working,* portable hotspot not working.* there are issues with cpu.* when i use usb tethering, the phone battery actually reduces instead of charging up or staying stable.* phone heats up a lot, which they will say it\\'s normal.* there might be even more faults with it which i may have not discovered as i haven\\'t used this phone much as i received it only three days ago and haven\\'t had chance to explore it more.not even happy with the service of amazon india . :-(extremely disappointed.doesn\\'t give me confidence to buy anything form amazon anymore with the type of service i received. :-( very nice mobile phone is owsome but it would be good if front camera is too good completely happy with the product i this price bracket and no heating issue guys until and unless you use it very heavily even human mind get hot if you use out of the limit for day to day usage it\\'s a very good phone highly recommended. i am in love with this device poor quality, camera stops working.and it\\'s screen bends. don,t buy ...world worst phone. good product at mid range mobile camera not so good as they claim .. good battery life ... good speed excellent phone.... camera quality nice ... quick and nice..but left stereotype speaker not functioning very good support for timed delivery the product is defective and i had asked for replacement. your engineer visited my place and after examining the product certified that it has a problem and needs replacement, however i\\'m still waiting for the same. not very good phone don\\'t buy its not worth . phone getting heated worst phone ever after update to android oreo it got heated , hangs and battery got drain fast and also charges vry slowly in this price rate it\\'s a very decent phone. everything works fine but 4 stars rating because of dual camera depth mode is ok not so good. better also works fine and turbo support charger works

any phone acessories except mobile charger ossom phone. value for money i will never recommend to buy this product from amazon. it started giving problem after 20 days and amazon has refused to accept the return policy as their so called return window was closed. when i visited customer service center, they informed me as there is a display problem, you have to pay 5,000 for repairing. this means that the phone was defective which amazon supplied to me. 1. though advertised as jio compatible being lte, does not work with jio sim. most of the time. we have made 3 visits to jio and after that, sometimes it works, sometimes not. sometimes jio calls work, sometimes jionet sometimes neither! you want a phone with 2 sims and it should be dependable, but not this one. you cannot trust it and take it with you and be sure that you can make/receive a call when you want it.2. turbo charging does not work - of course with the charger and the cable provided3. heats up quite a lot. gets very hot even when not in use.recommendation: do not buy till lenovo fixes these. not good lenovo k8 note volte hai kya it\\'s reality in 6th month is there it\\'s a bad product. worst phone ever i buy on

others are okay camera is not good previously i used samsung mobile , compare with that lenovo not meeting expectation but i like rom & ram about lenovo .final suggestion if u expect good mobile

range.....i never face any problem with it.....service to well.... it over heat ,not have any status bar features ,poor network connection .not have dual app feature, not have to separate ring tone for dual setting default ringtone only there thanks due to its heavy weight gorilla glass is not useful. my phone fall n screen broken down. screen cost is 5800 inr.its network catch quality is also not good.not handy - hv to manage with both hands.no galary, music/ video player, recording option, low light images quality is not good enough.rest is fine. please do not purchase this product. i have k3 and k5 and k8 note. the sound quality of k5 is awesome but k8 note has worst sound quality. don\\'t waste your money. good phone but bit overpriced. internet is full of reviews and specs so will not repeat it. following is the list of pros and cons from myside.cons :-1) gets warm while playing simple games like candy crush tho no problem watching videos and listening to music.2) personally i didnt find stock android os that great. i am in favour of few customization and features options from manufaturer. customization options are very limited. major put off for me.3) unread message badge counter for notification is missing. so if ur phone is on silent and u hv disabled notification u wont b able to know how many messages are unread in whatsapp, sms, facebook etc. you hv to manually open the each app and check the status now and then.4) no separate option for monitering call and message notifications ringtone. if u lower or mute call ringtone message tone would also be reduced or mute as the case may be.5) no ultra power saving mode option.6) no nfc, infrared, ir blaster and screen mirror options7) key board typing is not so smooth and lot of time i hv to edit wht i keep typing at high speed8) double tap to wake phone takes time9) battery hogging. even being 4000 mph battery it runs out in 7-8 hours flat compared to redmi note 4 which gives more than a day battery life10) very heavy n bulky. feels like u r carrying a small iron rod in the pocket.pros:-1) blazing fast speed to open and manage all apps2) premium look with all metal finish3) display panel excellent4) no hybrid sim slot. means u can use 2 sims and one memory card5) good ram management6) dedicated music key with customization optionpersonally i would not recommend this pure stock android phone to anyone. better options like redmi note 4, moto g5 + with similar specs available. worst product bought this in sep 2017. performed well for some months, then it started acting weird. proximity sensors don\\'t seem to work sometimes. contacts and phone app get stuck a lot. touch screen becomes unresponsive sometimes. have to restart the phone many times in a day. guys i am an engineer so writing this review after long study. phone hardware is absolutely awesome. however this is stock android so you can\\'t expect extra. lenovo need to change this looking for updates soon. function like screen casting is not working. some software issue need to fix but overall hardware is really good. phone overall is ok but camera performance average very bad .you have cheated, the product has so many software complaints from the first day itself.. dolby doesnt work on playing music, the. sound quality is very worst when comparing with my friends lenovo k8 note, worthless product, waste of time and money, pls dont buy this product from amazon, they are giving offers to attract us poor phon it\\'s ok,,, charger complaint in 2 months of use i can say only one thing about this... best. voice is low battery back up is not as expected already used phone. there is already a email id in the mobile when i switch on. single speaker only work.. stopped charging abruptly..it would not turn on good phone yes its awesome good mobile gorilla glass is not genuine. now my display is full of scratches.i bought it one month back.overall other features are good as mentioned value for money phone. last time i brought same mobile but i booked the gold i get black this time u didnt repeat again if u i will never visit ur site 64 gb internal memory with 4 gb ram, at below 15k price, this phone is best value for money. works smoothly and bettry also lasts long. the turbo charging is also super cool. overall 5* notification led problem, poor audio quality, patch issue and battery draining fast. not good phone very good phone for this price tag.. good product. every function working smoothly. nice product best phone under 12k and its sound very awsome....running phone very smoothly i brought a lenovo k8 note (fine gold 64 gb n 4gb ram) but i am totally disappointed after purchase this product, as this product is not up to the marks, if we thinking about lenovo products...my lenovo mobile screen is cracked just after 2 days of purchase and i can\\'t believe it\\'s screen is cracked/broken while dwon at floor just from 1/2 feet of height.what is purpose of gorilla glass that is claimed by lenovo because either it is not a original gorilla glass or lenovo making fool to thier customeri am tried to call lenovo customer case/service center and as per them new screen cost is 40%of the mrp. i.e. approx 6000.other disappointed things seems in lenovo k8 note it is over heating problem and also it\\'s heat when ph is charging. that\\'s very bad thing for lenovodull screen, weak networkdolby audio is only strategy by lenovo for selling purposes earphone issue . sound quality is low nd bad in earphone. earphone does not fully enter the point nd because of that many times music stops. plzzzzz fix this this is very third class phone. all specification wrong i think. phone is heating too much. it is taking 5 to 6 hour to get charged fully. i think lenovo is a cheater company i bought this phone, phone i good but am having network issue, n earfone, problem so nice product, all features in this price...thanks to lenovo... satticfied dual 4g standby mentioned above. that\\'s not true.only one sim as 4g can use at a time.i ordered this phone, so that both of my sim would have better 4g network simultaneously and now i feel like cheated. best phone on this price good mobile to purchase overall it is best choice one can have..during charging only heating issues...using time no heating..best atomos and camera good phone so far, but have noticed 2 problems.can\\'t set any music or song as ringtone , there is no such option.secondly there is no option of speed dialing. good one its awesome .. but dual back camera not clearly focus on object. truely not satisfied with service, music key not working and camera is also not that good that it should be very worst, batrry and heating problem. good experience with lenovo k8 note plus dual camera high definition as compared low cost nice phone .best deal some heating issue when i play asphalt 8 or any other game and i really unhappy when its price down 1000rs after a week of purchase... but overall good phone.. bakwas product display quality is too bad.battery drain very fast and when use wifi battery also drain very very fast .rapid charging working not well.camera bakwas ekdam.overall lenovo cheat up customer. don\\'t buy this mobile .... very average battery packup excellent phone at superb price..they have not mentioned it in description but it is 4 gb ram

backup very poor. this was no good product this battery was bad and this was switch off automatically i want to return this product guys ,i bought lenovo k8 note two weeks ago. i did downloaded shadow fight 3, the game was too lagging ...this phone lags alot when using data ..its battery is worst .this phone doesn\\'t even deserves 1 star rating getting heated easily nd battery backup not up to 4000mah remain all good...ui not user friendly left side speaker is not workingwhat can i doplease help to solve the issue runs smooth,ram and memory management is ok, but google drive doesn\\'t works properly, it behaves lethargically opening jpeg files, and zooming a jpeg file is not possible in this mobile. i replaced this set and received a new set. captured images and tried to get those zoomed after opening them with google drive,but each time google drive restart s on its own. so it\\'s an inbuilt fault. beautiful mobile phone is really good but only one disadvantage heats up when you plug in for charging. smart looking, nice device doesn\\'t have auto call recorder like lenovo k6 power and it\\'s flash is also not so powerful it could have better retring it\\'s amazing phone but has two major cons1. cast never happens to smart tv2.it cannot transfer data to usb directly.not supported. never buy this product not good looking,not performing well, over heating ok ok mobile very heat when using pls do not buy this phone. within 3 months the phone started heating and would not get charged. moreover battery life is also too short. guys don\\'t even think of purchasing this product or any other lenovo product. it\\'s waste of money. batter backup not good .no call recorder....waste good phone but i lost it :( better features... looking good ...but camera is somhow not so good.... battery ok.. there is something wrong with this k8 note as the phone is unable to receive the signals properly, most of the time it\\'s showing phone is switched of or out of coverage area, same sim working good in other device. every time we have to restart or remove the sim to get phone active. this is pathetic indeed. very disgusting product worst not a perfect one, lack of assories i.e earphone, my charger got burnt while charging within less than a month. setting facilities are not enough in compare to other mobile like samsung. not good phone is over heating up not fast charging system to late 2.30hrs good bt display is ...🤔 i got defective piece,phone function is not working, lagging every time, processor is two down,very slow phone. working well the battery is very poor.... everything good speaker sound is not good 1.heating problam2.tarbo charger is not good prominence(charging time is 2:30 to 3:00 hour)3. battery backup is only 1day(in data use)4.camara profomence get 2 star only awesome phone camera clarity is good totally phone is good this mobile doesn\\'t support volte.. only lte.. please explain how to upgrade it volte. i am happy to using lenovo k8 note the lenovo k8 note is having major issues with network reception. it doesn\\'t work on 4g. the same sim card works fine on redmi note 4 and mi 4i.lenovo works only when manually select 2g which is pathetic.amazon blancco diagnostic app says everything is fine but photo inbuilt status shows no signal.it show 0signal strength.amazon is fooling customer. after a huge fight i got my phone replacement but they didn\\'t provide refund. now with replacement phone it doesn\\'t provide option to refund or further replacement. you are only lucky 1 time if your phone is damaged or doesn\\'t work.lenovo must provide fix and amazon must improve on customer service. avareage performance i am facing some more issues on k8 note.1.phone frequently restarting on its own, sometimes when am doing nothing just kept on table or sometime when using some app...once or twice an hour.....phone is in my hand for 6 days now.2.my phone is made in india by some tamilnadu company for motorola, manufactured in aug17, with lattest software already updated......i feel chinise version is better, might not have so many problems..... i am going to return it??3.sometime, while some incoming phonecall is ringing or am watching some vdo, it made a craking sound like crack bell is ringing for 20/30 seconds and vdo stops/ incoming ring stops , i get puzzled what to do, then it restarts on its own.4.the volte sign euivallent special lenovo k8 style that hand phone picture with 4g written on top vanishes 2/3 times a day, but after again restarting it comes back...5. battery charging in device power off condition...in last 5/6 days for 5/6 times (4000mah doesn\\'t last full 1 day also)took 2 hours 30 minutes to 2 hours 41 minutes...what type of fast / turbo charging is this??6. google contact back up is not working at al, so back up & reset part is useles in setting, google photo showing date as 29 nov 2201.....but taking photo back ups.7.severe network problem.camera is so so..not so great , not so bad not so good as hyped in their advt. and tell you the truth i didnt face much heating problem in this 8 days before retun.taken to lenovo service center, shown the problems, they said to return immidiately, faulty set.adding again on 14/09/17......after clicking return button and following the proper returning procedures (where you really need to apply your brain, dont just click here and there like a fool, then will face much problem for return and refund, like many facing as per the reviews) on 12th night, an amazon techinician came to my house to inspect the phone and found that its really faulty, left a copy of inspection report with me, and within 10 mnts after he left my home, got a call from amazon, asking what i want replacement or refund ??? mad or what?? again same k8 note..pagal hai keya....asked for a refund....pick up scheduled fixed today 10-1pm......pick up boy came at 1:25pm....3:30pm my money is in my bank....wwww oooo wwww what a fantastic 10********** star service from amazon.....flipkart-wala wont refund you untill the shipper confirms that the goods rec\\'d in good condition....takes about 10 working days since the return packet leaves your home.no star for lenovo k8 note, don\\'t waste your money, although it was my dream set........10 star for amazon customer service. all things are well but depth mode is not so good. it also blur things which we don\\'t want to good don\\'t like it . heating issue.battery as like 2000mahmusic is very poor through earphone.camera quality is also not good..overall a bad purchase phone is good but it heat after some use and also battery will drain too fast very dangerous mobile.don\\'t buy it bust excellent product worth its money spent i\\'m facing problem with dual sim, as it is not working properly when both sim is inserted, either it will show switch off or not reachable, i\\'m fed of this issue this product is good. i have used this lenovo k8 note for just 3 months but after updating android from 7 to 8 (oreo) my phone battery heats up automatically and drains so much. i think l should return it headset jack does not work , battery drains very soon, device gets heated up very soon i want to speak with you in tamil super ga vundi after 10 days of use charger works not properly...in the beginning it took 1.5 hrs to chargenow it takes more than 2.15 hrs to chargeat some time the charger is not connected,,now it takes 3hrs to chargesame issue comes to another buyer..nd also battery life is not so good...with heavy use last up to 8-9 hrs...with mormal use 12-13 hrs..after further use the turbo cahrger stops workingbattery life sucks... this a good mobile and having great performance perfect phone with everything fine. the problem is the battery life. being a 4000mah battery and not running for a whole day with moderate use. also the rear dual camera depth enabled pics are not that catchy as other phones in the range after the update the phone\\'s battery has started to drain very quickly and while charging it gets very hot!!...and sometimes it lags tooo. battery back up is very poor.. not even one day will stand in regular usage with out switch on data.. and turbo charging will more then 2 hours to charge... and other performance is good... and very draw back for the phone is battery main problem call recorder iz not working in this.. very bad thing..😞all over performance average..camera gud but low light very bad experience.. ☹️battery average..processor ok..display, touch gud..google assistant gud.. good mobile but complicated to send sms only mobile lenovo k8 received bill not received so plz my will mere mobile ke sath bill nhi aya h sir apse nibedan h ki mera bill mujhe bhej de

after repair by authorised service center (ranchi).2. most horrible experience at the authorised service center (ranchi).3. phone call is never attended by the authorised service center ( ranchi) personnel.4. on visiting the service center ranchi, i was made to feel that i was the victim, & i made a great mistake by buying the product lenovo k8 note! good but charger not working properly it is as per my expectations phone is getting overheated while charging and even using apps like whatsapp, facebook & even browsing too. it is absolutely not fit for oreo update. please dont go for os update if you bough this device.. though it says atmos dolby, the volume of speakers isnt good. no call recording is possible even with external apps. lenovo is very bad with the updates. while other manufacturers are rolling out the updates as soon as possible, lenovo will take 7-8 months. go for mi a1 instead worst phone.... don\\'t buy... phone suddenly switched off after 3 months of buying.. won\\'t turn on... motherboard dead... got repaired from service center... but after that facing lot of issues.... full battery drains in 2-3 hours after just switching on mobile data... again visited service center... they do not have any solution.... as per them ... lot of other people have complained regarding this issue and are waiting for lenovo to provide update which might resolve this issue... i have stopped using the phone...never buy mobile from amazon especially lenovo brand..worst experience... hard earned money waste... battery is very bad......amazon return policy is also very bad......kindly don\\'t buy very nice phone but sometimes battery charging problem... overall rating of lenovo k8 note super. very nice nice mobile bed bettry lenovo k8 note heating problem nice phone phone mat lena pese west ho ge to verigoud products android oreo isn\\'t coming in my lenovo k8 note. as it already come to k8 note. excellent function at this price defective product, doesn\\'t work...donot waste your money. i bought the product on 10th may, it worked for one night, post oreo update the phone started hanging.took it to lenovo customer care center bu the problem was not resolved, have been without phone since then.today,12th may a technician from amazon visited and confirmed about the issue and told he would update amazon by 4:30 pm in evening and the resolution will be provided in next 48 hours. i have already waited 4 days and now i still need to wait 2 more days for any resolution.i need my money to be refunded.lenovo k8 note (venom black, 4gb) with new system update my time , data and money are wasted. the best flagship killer phone that i have used. it’s now almost one month using the phone and no doubt it’s the best smartphone. #killernote #lenovok8note.....#theflagshipkiller good one te phone\\'s good in this price range guys...k8 note does not have most important gallery app, music player app, screen shot app, so it is very difficult to delete you daily what\\'s app images n videos. for music you really have to work hard to get thru the songs stored in mobile. not a good choice this time for k8 note. battery is also bad, last for a day only on light usage. very good performance...a good phone in this budget. good poooooor camera but good speed and performance. system gets heat while browsing and charging like batary back up is very bad. and it hanging problem is also in this phone worst mobile ever it\\'s good verygood product....... nice nice phone perfect phone at this range! to be late dilevery in my address, nd not a earphone with this phone , nd some time changing power are so slow work nd battery are vry speedy discharge. was good awesome mobile. every feature is completely good. ui is easy and never lags when working on high appliations. good overall good but coming to charging it\\'s poor.camera quality good. great mobile good phone its very good smart phone with lower price. perfect for shopping app😍 good battery super fast do not buy, having many problem like sounds , picture quality and battery life heating problem as i have guessed... otherwise good one... bluetooth not working,fingerprint sensor average,go for another one,rear flash also not good there are many features missing which lenovo had in its older models for eg in a7000 had waving / blink to take selfiees. notifications bar had many system ui icons such as night mode etc which is missing in k8 note it\\'s a great phone. with lot of expectations went for the phone.the finish was so good and it was light weight. the android 7 was neat and the phone. didn\\'t face any lagging or heating during my initial use.the disappointment was more on the turbo charging and especially on the camera. the turbo charging was not as quick as i had expected so that was a bit disappointing. still a decent speed and we can live by it.the camera experience was one of the worst that i have come across in the five years. i am not sure if it was a bad piece i received or k8 note itself is of such low quality. in past i have used nexus 5, meizu note 2, redmi note 3 and moto g4 plus and when compared to those mobiles the camera specifications were a bit high in this. one of the major reasons i went for this one was for the camera specs it boasted of. sadly all pics either in depth mode, hdr, or even normal mode were of very very low quality. i would rate the camera 1/10.if you are not worried about the camera then you can go for it. i have returned my phone alreadyp.s: again i am not sure if my piece was a fault one but as far as my experince goes this is a total waste of money purely for the worst camera experince. before updating this phone to 8.0 oreo, it is the best phone but now it is not functioning properly.you feel useless. nice phone in this range best phone in this range for gaming ☺️ phone turn off while using & when gets truns on the fingerprint scanner doesn\\'t work then difficult to replace or return the phone phone is over heating awesome mobile... suber performance... superb phone with nice smooth curved edges which gives a good hold and comfort rather than firm and sharp edges. performance makes this phone worthy...n also it\\'s protective gorilla glass of top quality and splash resistance nano coating technology and android 7 makes gives the final touch. happy with my first lenovo.thanx amazon best phone for this budget battery backup is very very bad. nice mobile, good config. over heating issue no super pover save mode k5 note is best then k8 note hedset sound is not at all good and sigle strength is very poor phone is so much hittingcamera is not working properlyworst phone camera and speakers not up to standard. build quality could have been better too. there is a considerable lag when you play games. not the best phone from lenovo. lenovo and motorola has variety but aftersells-service is very very bad.....most of lenovo phone\\'s problem is touch or pda fai.... not as expected good battery backup😙 no recording feature and no headphones provided as with previous lenova phones provided headphones timely delivery, product exactly as per description, packaging good, lenovo k8 note after using it for 4 days is excellent & economical as compared to vivo v5 plus rs. 15999 (old price) and samsung s8 plus rs. 58500lenovo k8 note (venom black, 4gb) with new system update its not dual standby 4g+4g its a 4g+3g.when i insert jio sim and trying to video call via phone dialer it\\'s not supported .require jio 4g voice app then working .. while lenovo claiming on amazon website that it\\'s a voice over lte . so before buying know about this fact.it seems like lenovo is cheating only good phone at this price range some software issue is there in this phone other wise it a killer nice phone, but i regret the price for which i purchased it. after a month of my purchase, it dropped on some online platforms to 70% of what i paid here! satisfied with product.but i am dissatisfied with some of futures not there.like1.main bug is can\\'t able to save contacts in phone memory.2. some of futures are not there in notification center and status bar like main options are lock, screenshot buttons not there.3. there is no option to display internet speed and battery%.due these bugs i am giving 3 rating. i am expecting that vendor will provide update by adding these or some of futures. screen has breaked good product... system software update are available now. good performance. 😎😍😘 battery and camera are not good bad battery quality. best camera battery packuo only one week after it go wost conditionturbo charger is taken for charge 3housrhanging problem also it\\'s there very nice phone, met my expectations not bad, bt camera not working in dual mode dispoint dolby atmos sound very low volume earphone and camera improvement product received is good quality but the earphone is missing in the box though it is mentioned on the warranty card. look is not good..... the drop down does not work properly, keeps hanging.. scolling is not as good as the older phones. i am very disappointed.bluetooth pairing issues. very average camera. not volte supported , heating issues ,single day battery performed with normal use , other than this rest things are fine. i have purchase lenovo k8 fine gold mobile on 12th october2017 on emi but suddenly comming from job my mobile is theft in train i have doing insurance on this product give some information about them awesome phone.... camera is not good enough spellbound no good phone.. do not waste your money mic was not working.. out of the box. really pathetic i got with discount and in that price i got a good phone , camera quality if pretty good , video in day light is awesome , battery is ok ok but design can be better.one major con is lenovo service is pathetic none of updates are coming is this phone phone is no doubt good, but battery should have been of 5000 to 6000 mah it\\'s display has not clearitiyand battery backup not enough am i theonly one who is facing issue with left speaker . the best phone only heating problem while using internet.except this mobile is good.. good mobile good performancequick charginggood battery backupbut camera is average performance and camera are as mentioned it\\'s a killerturbo charger is effective since it\\'s charging 4000mah battery in 90mins that\\'s way coolthe things is the processor since it\\'s a 10core mediatek processor it consumes energy to perform so battery backup is not so effective,but in idle condition without internet it comes around 18hours backup,those who expects performance then battery it\\'s a sure go mobilereview placed after 15days of usage i just buy 2 weeks ago... now i have to charge full night to get 100 percent... i don\\'t know whats the issue?? value for money in this budjet best phone & the power full smartphine nice phone,and i got this phone in 2 days multiple issues with softwares network issues i have purchased lenovo k8 note. this product is really disappointed me it is missing the basic cast future. even 4000 rupees mobile is having this feature but lenovo is missing this basic concept. they are suggesting to purchase a chromecast to cast the screen. it is not worth because recently every tv is coming with the smart future with advanced features in built for the casting. lenovo has to take it on priority and need to release the update. with out cast feature this mobile is really waste of money and better to choose other mobile. this has no recorder. worse, it doesn\\'t have the facility for even a third party, two-way recording app which i require for professional work. why couldn\\'t this company even mention that it doesn\\'t have a recorder like it\\'s previous products ? felt cheated. battery life is very poor. issues with software within few days of purchase itself. very bad experience.it is not even a month since purchase, there is no option to even return or replace the phone. good phone i\\'m satisfied with this phone services. it’s software is not common of all other indian mobiles, very different we can’t follow its good and no heating issue this handset is hanging .battery backup low&below soft key didn\\'t work. i like very much the battery of the phone is draining very fast and battery backup is not upto the mark as was promised by lenovo. worth the money. great camera, good performance and good battery backup. just go for it. :) don\\'t buy this phone,mobile was hanging , sound quality was worst ,camera is not good as of 13 mp, specially front one is worst.heating problem is occurred during playing game and video\\'s.it is heated up drastically on calling and sound quality goes down drasticallyi have return it to amazon but still money have not been refunded.now a days amazon brand name has become cheater company. perfect n best mobile average. not good

material great phone over heating, worst camera clarity, power button not working etc., love it! real smooth and fast and no issues so far! superb performance.. beautiful looks.. processor and ram definitely beats all others phones within this price.. pics quality is also very good.. solid build packages.. value for money.. screen resolution s**ks completely..tryied to return the item within 4 days but amazon seems not frandlier to their customers as before. camera performance completely lagging.don\\'t buy this product. great productfast deliverymy mom using it over a month, and she loves itnice piece 👍🏻 good product i bought this awesome mobile. initially i bought a lenovo k3 note and i had some issues like heating problem and phone hanging during playing games. now i bought lenovo k8 killer note. by the name itself,it showcases the power of this mobile. i am using it over 3 months and i am damn sure its a very good android phone also its performance is very good. pathetic phone.... over heating even with moderate use in just 5 minutes the device heats up.... camera is rubish just a gimmick for dual camera..... tv screen cast does not work.... battery drains like an open tap with with flowing water. the only thing which is good is the the dolby atmos thats it.... rest all sucks.... would not recommend anyone to take this phone. nice excellent phon not better with redmi phone lenovo k8 note main problem is heating. even normal internet searching phone get worm quickly & also worm quickly during watching movies. first 10 days u will feel that it is best but after some days u will find promblems like intense heating,no fast charging,and fast battery draining best mobile good nice mobile, having good camera result awesome phone front flash and camera not good 1.network issue2.display is dull3.phone hangs a lot4.unable to produce real bokeh effectsinstead of buying this phone...donate your money to beggar\\'s... one of the best cell in budget range .and it has everything .no one does provide all in this range.stock android, excellent both cameras front as well as back ,dual front camera , splash proof, gorilla glass , great sound for music lover and yes thank to deca core processor who made me to buy this sell,i am not a mediatek lover but tnx to k8 note that they had brought deca core in this range and made this mobile best . hopeless mobile from lenovo don\\'t buy this phone total waist of money. i like this fon very much best mobile..... very nice touch and screen brightness! good speaker sound.but problematic for right hand users and the hard back button is on left side. also, the images send to show usb type c port, but it is the normal micro usb port. overall a good phone in the budget. mast mobile phone very bad there is no earphone inside the package. this phone is not dual 4g stand by. be careful.. its a worst product in my life time ,because the 4000mah battery is for name sake only. it dont have any gorilla glass. plz,plz,plz..... its my humble request you to don\\'t buy it. cast function not working, with update battery life has shorten... good nice product, service is very good 2 star less for showing fake idea offer with this product.. the note 8 is a real disappointment, the bluetooth is of very poor quality, just doesn\\'t maintain constant connection beside having intermittent static . there is no great improvement over k5 note in terms of displace and connectivityoverall a poorer version of k5 notelenovo need to if required recall the k8 to fix the bluetooth issue all phone seems to give good performance, but it lacks in better sound quality. even after having dolby sound is too low, may be hardware problem. overall it\\'s a good buy. it don\\'t give me a charger of mobile and i receive it 23 november mobile is getting hot frequently. when tried to return the product, amazon portal advising to contact mobile tech support. good if you want use 4g sim in both slots you will be disappointed.. 😟 otherwise phone is good not worth i think lg q 6 is better then this ? video calling is not good. rather than battery backup i am satisfied with other things in this mobile.. although i kept my phone in idle condition almost 5%of power is consuming every hour.. volte wont work in battery saver mode,it was advertised as 4g + 4g phone, it is not true. one sim can be used as 4g sim and other sim has to be on 3g or 2g network,signal strength is not good compared to owned redmi note 3, nexus 5 and zenfone 2.dolby atmos stops working if you install any other music player,it gets switched off after charging, used to charge at night and found it gets switched off every day,i installed battery temp monitor software, it gets too much hot ~40 deg c while playing games and while on charging, and remain hot for normal use compare to owned redmi note 3, nexus 5 and zenfone 2,i don\\'t see any use of booster charger, it takes too much time to charge the phone.finally i returned the the product, it is not easy to return the product on amazon unless u have hardware fault and for that technician visit is needed. hi i am using lenovo k8note... very poor ui. many features are not available...and improper response from lenovo support. good front and rear camera quality not satisfied.very very worst quality in camera.ringtone settings memory card options not connected.both sim network problem. awesome mobile charging is slow and phone is heating when in process i want return this item all features are good but battery sucks!!! i used this phone last 15 days... charging is very slow even it is turbo charging. product ke sab function sahi he camera battery is good...phone but automatically restart any time..dont buy amazon vo log replace bhi nhi kr ke de rahe he....unake tarfse ek bandha bi ake gaya but 30 minit ho bandhe ke samne kuch hua nhi ab fir se vahi issue chalu he but ab vo.log gallery jake ek report lavo bol rahe he..inki galati or ham bhukate....dont buy amazon good product camera is awesome and display quality is great!!! great product the product was delivered as on the date and the service is impeccable. the product is very superb and meets the expectations. product is good what i didn\\'t like :this cell phone was running smooth till the time i started getting updates.after the recent updates , specially after theandroid 8.0 , i.e. the oreo updatethis model has come up with so many problems1. call connectivity : i ain\\'t able to talk to someone on calls properly as it starts loosing the connectivity , or rather it\\'ll be like , i\\'m able to hear the person in talking to but the person on the other side isn\\'t able to hear anything i say ..its got so bad that every time i call someone up they hang up saying \"bro i\\'m not able to hear u rn , i\\'ll call u back later .\"2. heating issues : you know what\\'s the amazing part ..this cell phones gets heat up ...even when its not in use \"woooww!\"i\\'m tried of this heating issue , it gets to level where u can\\'t , literally... hold your cell...3. hanging issues: this cell has got me so crazy coz it hangs every now and then and lags performance ..they talk abt the high end processor in this cell ..i guess its \"just on paper\" stuff , and m not even able to use two app together , like instagram and what\\'s app .and if i switch to musically or snapchat , this cell just hates me then and goes black , \"i guess gotta talk to my cell abt it and settle it ! , ryt!?\"4. camera : (i guess i\\'ll end up listing all the aspects of this cell , anyway )camera in this cell phone is good , trust me on that , but it is when it wishes to be .low light photographs are terrible.it keeps on loosing focus , every time.it sometimes doesn\\'t even start up .. and then i have to reboot it...5. video / picture quality : this cell phone\\'s video quality is too bad ...while u take it ...you\\'ll feel it\\'s good , but when u save it and seeit\\'s all noisy and full of glitches\"as if i don\\'t have sufficient net and m seeing a youtube video on 144 or 240 pixels\"6. battery life : ( okay i\\'ll stop on this point , coz honestly i never wrote such big reviews )so ... battery life of this cell is pathetic guys ,its so bad ..that it just lasts for 2 hrs 30 mins \\'80%\\' in use ....i can\\'t even carry it without a power bankcoz this cell looses its life so quick.on the standby mode itself .if i had an option of time and availability of cell phone (as my cell is already dead , loosing 56% of its battery in 1hr 15mins , and all i was using is a fitness app ) to attach few pictures of the section where battery usage is displayed ( i forgot what it\\'s called ) i would\\'ve shown u the standby usage ... it\\'s first in my \"major\" usage list using 55% of life....battery life is the major issue i face rn , coz i don\\'t play games and .. now i don\\'t feel social sites that imp that they become my priority so when it gets heat up or lags / hangs i keep it aside and study or do somethin else , but calls and emergency texts or something imp need to be given priority ryt? but this cell doesn\\'t allow me to take it as it\\'s already displaying \"battery saver mode on\"*sigh .if you\\'ll did read this wholeeee thing , thanks nd i\\'m sorry i don\\'t have the time to write down abt the good things in this cell phone , i\\'m sure you\\'ll find many other sources to find that out .few good things are:* if u know how to use your frnd (cell) it takes amazing pictures in day light , i love taking pictures though ..and this cell is way better than most other cell phones out there* it\\'s performance (before the update) was amazing and smooth i was able to switch between real quick . again. ..better than most other phones* and many other stuff ...so i rated it three coz it\\'s eventually lacking everything , \"but i love my cell phone\" 😂i mean .. ik this cell is really good it\\'s just the unstable updates that have ruined it . battery is very poor and touch very poor seller.... worest phone ever. old plasticy feel. avarage camera i hate thisi want to exchange please phone ta khanik bade hot hoa jay. very good...no any problem.. still it\\'s just batter then my lenovo vibe k-4 note, but not too much differences between both & bow prise less then my prise it\\'s now available in 10,999 & i have cave 12,999 for this. no call recording feature what a ridicolous phone. value for money camera is not good good product excellent phone. camera quality is outstanding. amazon delivery smooth, quick, no complaintsabout the phone now(around 1 week later):great display and looks, decent hardware, no heating issues, battery charges pretty quickly, front camera is a bit weak and slight jio connectivity issue is there.apart from that no other big issue, cheers amazon! nice one mobile is good when bluetooth wireless connection come it\\'s not working properly good product very nice product.k8note overall one word - superb performance and battery power i have buy this mobile, and i am use since 1 months, after updating the rear upper canada(13 mp) canada is not working.. i am so sad about this.. plz anybody give solutions plz very bad mobile, cast screen not working, amazon not agree for replacement, pls don\\'t buy this chinese mobile. i want return the phone. battery backup is very bad bad baddon\\'t buy this phone please i request you don\\'t buy this phone product is good ,long battery life ,big screen quality product camera very very slow don\\'t buy this phone its worst phone and when you use to play normal game and watching videos than its so much heat.my suggestions is not to buy this k8 note you can buy k8 plus instead of k8 note because k8 plus is performance well and also they not heat like note. the phone is behaving strange. it shuts down on his own when placed on charging. sometimes it restarts as well. osm automatic crack to display in the mobile speaker doesn\\'t work.. i had to go to the service centre. superb mobile. ultimate performance. its a must buy. i have book on 18th august delivery was nice on timephone is not turbo charging it will take 1.30 hours for charging not happy with this.figure print sensor some time not recognizes properly bought it for my dad. just a great phone with stock android. the camera could have been a lot better but for the money, can\\'t really complain. excellent performance in price.heating problem and camera quality is not as expected.over all good budget phone. awesome battery backup, camera, performance , sound quality the phone is light weight n looks are awesome. but only i found it difficult to insert sim cards n memory card because of the key use. if the key gets misplaced then it would be very difficult to change sim\\'s. otherwise the phone is good corilla glass broken do not buy this priduct good buy. nice product phone does not found on my phone awsme phone with many great and cool features.. nice mobile better than lenovo note 6. chargers faster. does not heat up as much like k6. quite a resemblance to redmi note 4. good product yet don\\'t buy it until oreo patch is provided, the oreo update as of 3 may 2018 made the experience of this mobile worst, battery drains in 5-6 hours, charging time 8-10 hrs, wait till oreo patch that can help to stabilise the performance amazing phone with affordable price !!headphone jack output sound quality is poor compare to the other models. why is the phone turns off on its own,sometimes during charging and sometimes anytime nice the 3.5 mm jack delivers so low sound... the dolby atmos is useless coz of it... the phones good but lenovo seriously needs to get killer notes software updates for headphone jack volume. and it\\'s not the headset issue. i am using a sound magic. similar issues experienced by people using boat, jbl, 💀 candy. it\\'s all over lenovo forum\\'s but they aren\\'t paying no heed worst mobile that i bought. phone performance is good but camera quality is not as 13mp, also deft mode is worse . excellent product.... very nice.pic quality must fine. it is a great phone. one of the reasons which make this phone great is that there is a separate sd card slot. superbbb up till now good phone, but paid ₹1000 more as price dropped. killer phone....but amazon delivery is so poor..... only one led color notification good camera amazing processor, but heats up when 40mins of gaming but it\\'s okay in these price rangeoverall perfect product in these price range awesome good value for money phone, but bad battery backup.day to day usage is ok. you would need to run for your charger every now and then. plus heating, you can cook an omelette occasionally. lenovo k5 is far better than k8 good speedapps open very quicklygood net surfinggood camera(but dont compare it with samsung or iphone camera)depth mode and depth editor needs improvement.very good design and lookingbattery life is average(less than a day with average uses)sometimes it heats up specially while charging and using camera(it heppens with me only one time).overall this phone is good.heating issue is there very good nice mobile in k8 note. not satisfied, battery is draining very fast even using single sim.also charging takes too much time. worst phone this is bad mobileautomatically mobile is offthis mobile is always hangso i suggest to don\\'t buy this lenovo k8 note this cell is very awesome....... it\\'s my personal experience... those who are music lover it\\'s very awesome.. and also camera is superb cool...... totally it\\'s a value for money.... i bought this as i wanted to get upgraded from mi note 3 { my version was 3gb/32gb }this is a disappointment as i expected a robust device with helio and 4gb ram. i didn\\'t liked the stock android too. may be i am used to miui version of android.cons :1. apps getting slow while using2. stock sms app is fail as it doesn\\'t group #notifications like miui does. there is no copy otp option.3. no screenshot button on the drag down menu from top4. battery isn\\'t great although i am not a gaming enthupros:1. only one , that\\'s listening to music thru dolby atmos* don\\'t buy this if you are already using xoami / vivo / oppo / coolpad types. this is a useless piece of mobile at first i would like to thank amazon for taling back this product. this mobile is an unmarked product with hitension issues or in other words its like expected a ton received a corn and again its not sweet corn.i would like to advise smart buyers that display over the screen and display after taking pics and videos recorded have a vast difference, as many said that amazing crystal clear display.camera fearures have given a tight slap to buyers and video recording has smacked every ones head down. its like recording with 2 mp basic hand set.i wish i can put more comments, since i got my refund i am tight lipped now..wont be trusting lenovo here after.actually one should appreciate the video director for making all those random experiences that neither works nor responds..regret & regards. camera quality is very poor. picture ko joom karne par dhundli ho jati hai.. or ek network security dusre network me jane par network search karvana padta hai..varna outgoing or incoming band ho jati hai.. it\\'s camera is not working ... 1. they are no call recorder2. network poor if handset not detected network mobile factory reset network works normally.3. casting didn\\'t work.i\\'m already used k4,k5 but k8 is worst experience. best mobile in this price range. bye bye to all issues that irritated us in other android devices. google photos is very slow in copy/cut and pasting files on to memory card and is failing quite often in simple cut/ copy paste function which i am sure can be corrected in future updates. overall a fantastic mobile. phone is nice but gets hanged.on speaker mode the voice is not clear. best phone mobile working speed is very low. headphones socket was not working, in built auto call recorder is not available and this model is not user friendly like vibe k4 note. nice bad oreo update best phone in this price supob when deal will start on this phone not worth... back duel cameras are not so great... picture quality is poor... camera not as expected it hangs sometimes camera is not good..rest features is ok.. really cool features amazing phone..!! best experience of stock android. good battery life approx 1and half day on full charge.. hidden features are also good.. battery is looser.battery life line is low time.camera problem.mobile very heat. one of the best worst phones ever by lenovo.i guess lenovo does not make any good .every thing about this phone is bad.it hangs a lot,battery drains very fast, apps don\\'t work properly,it is waste of money .very disappointed with the lenovo company overall good design,processor smooth n camera quality good battery back up a days usage with internet n calls.slightly battery warms up on continues usage good product.... phone immediately shut down after 10% battery remaining face problem too many time. very nice head phone are not connecting awesome phone... i love it phone performance is amazing good product awesome look really like it excellent mobile awesome ..super look best mobile lenovo fast delivery....but camera quality is poor.. battery is awesome .proceceer gd not bad. dual rare camera even is not capable to take reasonable shots there is technical problem in divice very bad design from the lenovo...camera performance is below average...should have been better if 4k recording is there..very disappointed on purchasing this..don\\'t go for it better go for samsung on nxt in the same price or honor 7x... very very good phone for the price range..no heating issuesperfect jio connectivitysoftware update already there for improving cameravalue for money notification light problem. only works with msg and charging superb nice product i have using this product, there is no problem , best smart phone, no heating, best phone. network connectivity issue is there. there is inconsistency with hotspot connectivity as well. at the same time you can not connect more that two devices through hotspot. good product for a good price. so far soo good good very unhappy with this phone. the touchpad is not working properly, both incoming and outgoing calls get cut after a few mins, the phone dials another number when i\\'m already on a call. i would like to return this phone. i wouldn\\'t have given even 1star but then the review doesn\\'t get posted. good features camera is very bad.... i have battery problem in my mobile. mobile battery (fully charged) discharge in 7to8 hours in data off position. please show me how to replace the phone. in 6 month phone screen become yellow. because of heating issue. turbo charging is slow now. device is getting hit while playing games. not good !! not have that much of expectation. this product is very nice but in this product is manufacturer defective i have facing problem in bluetooth connection when i have use portable bluetooth speaker than after some time the song hanging issue... improve your hardware.... always screech.... sound quality is not impressive in speaker mode. volume is low. poor bluetooth connectivity. unable to use bluetooth paired in car as connectivity gets lost very frequently and is disturbing. volume is low even when connected using aux cable.rest of the performance is impressive not working proprly in 1month itself nice prodect febulus received couple of days back....everything is fine wrt handset and features.....worth for this rate..... what is use of ur policies if customers hv to undergo tons of processes for resolution of problem. launching an exclusive phone..i purchase it and find defects..but tech wll visit confirm thn replace but not return order and rrfund cause ur policy is lik tht ...horrendous experience of purchasing mobile phone online for the first tym..lenovo k8 is very bad phone..heating issues..hangs suddenly..touchscreen non responsive at times..thn had to switch off n on again..tht too took a while to switch on...all this only after a week\\'s use...no problem wth amazon delivery... good phone phone getting heatup.. sir es order ko mene emi se purchase kiyakya meri emi complete ho gai not good as it described in specifications poor camera quality in dual camera function. not satisfied at all.. heats up .and low camera quality at dim light there is no auto call recording option as in previous version. there is no separate gallery. double depth camera is not up to the level. lots of improvement required. i really liked the sound quality of the device. it’s a little heavier than i expected. the dual camera usage is not as accurate as i thought it would be. the depth is not very pronounced. but it does give a good picture quality.overall, a good buy in its price range. as it is dolby atmos the speakers should be in upper n bottom like lenovo k4. front camera awsome back okgood performancebattery charging not that much fastertherebis no extra fetures like modified rom this is i dont likegood budget mobile really nice i highly recommend not to buy this. lenovo let itslf down by not checking the phone before launching. battery draining like hell, bluetooth connectivity is a problem. software has bugs, not able to recieve calls sometyms. i have to press power button twice to make screen work to recueve calls. dual camera which lenovo says is a forte is not having enough features to even compete with other lower end single camera phones. i am trapped, not received the update yet. and amazon will not take back the product once bought until u have physical damage. i like the material quality & picture quality after orieo update .phone is hanging a bit and charging is drain very quickly . i loved this phone so much that i bought 3, one for me, one for my mom and another one for my aunt. the first two bought a month and two month back were made in china 😔 and the one bought yesterday was only made in india. so depressed and confused. why the other two were made china 😢should i raise a complaint against amazon or lenovo ? this is a great device at this price range.. camera quality is very good but depth mode is not so good..very good user interface..mediatek x23 processor seems poweful.. nice mobile. delivery was on time. very ghtiya phone don\\'t by itit\\'s betery issuedin me 3 baar charge krna pdta h yr net off me b bahut ghtiya phone dia h amazon neuper se camera quality ruff nice product and good price.......... sale waste product battery does not come even 5hours nice mobile phone....but already a lot of feature rich phones available in market in this price range average model not good. there is much better option in this price range. gud phone... battery backup is good... and sound is also good.. if you listen music along with some good head phone it will be awesome.... super earphone not received i would have happily given a 4* rating had it not been for the atrocious delivery quality of amazon.positives:- it has a premium look and feel, and good build quality.- setting up was easy.- battery life is quite good, with more than 1 day for my normal usage.- display quality is very good.- both front and rear cameras are reasonably good for the average user. read negatives below.- split screen feature with two apps running at the same time is useful for people who really need it. otherwise a novelty.- flash can be turned on in video recording, which is another novelty with no significant improvement in video brightness except a drain on the battery.negatives:- lenovo claims turbo-charging, but with the standard micro-usb port and the charger provided, charging is not very fast. it took about 90 minutes to charge from 15% to full. would hardly qualify as \\'turbo\\'.- the nougat os provided is stock android with very little customisation possibilities, so may not be liked by users who are used to heavy uis on other phones - but once you get used to it you will start accepting it.- the bokeh effect with dual rear camera is just so-so, and many times the layer separation is not as precise as you expect it to be, so you will not get desired results everytime. also, when you turn on the dual camera, the front layer is also slightly out of focus. on the whole, you can forget that you have dual rear cameras, and stick to single camera mode for peace of mind.- missing \\'slow-motion\\' and 4k recording are a shame. panorama mode does not even cover 180 degrees.overall good value for money. go for it if you want performance and not care for camera features. over all it\\'s a very good device .but battery is some what do not buy this product. despite of good hardware configuration this mobile fail to provide basic features. camera do not focus on particular object after tapping. the much talked dual camera captures photo with very little blureness which looks too artificial as if edited in cheap photo editing software. battery drains too quickly. stock android is too much overloaded with google ads. so even if ur mobile is screen locked video and other ads keep playing and generates sound. brightness fail to lower its intensity in dark. you can not cast the device screen on tv as it fails to detect the tv. even from the video player you can not cast the screen. this device do not provide that feature. i exchange my k5 note ,but i need now i will pay exchange amount great phone everything is fine , but battery backup is not so good.. notification light not working properly.. can\\'t change the set ringtone manually... camera quality not good worst after sale service ever seen of any product.charger is not working within 20 days of purchage.lenovo service center ka rule ye hk adapter ko change krwane k liye sath me mobile or bill laaousk baad ve mobile k 40 test krenge 1 ghnte tak.jisme fon ka sara data b khtm hone ka risk h.fir wo charger replace krenge.itni ghtiya service kisi company ki nhi hwill never buy any product of lenovo company in future... i bought device when the launch happened. happy with performance and battery backup. but much worried about heat issue and price drop. i can see a huge price drop within a month. good product in this price line excellent very good smart phone cool it\\'s been 8 months since the time i have purchased , the phone is great, got update for android 8.0 3 weeks

switch off after fully charged! very nice phone to buy at this range in branded section..quality of both the cameras are awesome.. absolutely amazing phone with good features and specs. timely

customer care , they told me there application smart check will decide whether my phone is having any issue or not, which i need to download in my mobile. costly as compared to features gud phone in this range....k8 hangeg problem great phone for low budget. fast and awesome. good mobile a good phone, only draw back no in built gallery i love it my favt ....nice mobile great display, touch,

in hand and feels heavy too. in earlier phone, when i type the last 4 digits of a phone number, i get the full number autosuggested. this one doesnt have the feature. turbo charge is good with original charger, but very very slow charging from car-usb or laptop-usb. great and quick ...all i needed and ibgot good experience with lenevo.good 4g speed long battery, camera clearity,i can\\'t think a out dual camera\\'s 5 mp what to do bad one plz dont purchase it good prodact value for money writing the review after 2-months usage:good one. though ordered for someone else but it\\'s worth price. working fine and camera is ok ok. sound quality is good and works smoothly. camera performance is very low primary and secondary.. battery performance is not satisfied they notice 4000mh ..there is not any performance as deca processer... i want my refund back plz give my refund or exchange this phone i bought this phone with so many expectations but it destroys that expectations.. plz give my refund back.. plz plz plz worst mobilepls. pls. pls. don\\'t buy this.within 15 days all cameras didn\\'t work this phone as a whole comes with a lot of surprises and shocksphone hangs often and the second slim slot does not support!battery last longer than other mobilesdual camera is very useful it is really a good phone to buy touch is really smooth only the dual camera effects are not up to marks i had purchased this product 10 days ago from amazon.in this is what the problems i found on this purchase1. notification light doesn\\'t work properly.2. signal bar continously fluctuating up and down.3.battary drains very quickly like if game at 100% battery for 30 to 40 min it comes down to 60-65% down. even if u keep idle it still loses 8-9 % battery from 100%.4. camera depth enabled option have issue in taking photos. even front camera doesn\\'t seems like its 13 maga pixal very poor.5. heat up during browsing internet.pls lenovo team look into this matter , can\\'t believe phone is in sale with all this problem. very good product... good product but data cable not working waste mobile good mobile for the rate very bad product i bought before 3 months hundred percent network issue very bad product no customer service solo my problem bought in january so writing review after 5 months... i got this phone for 11k in some offer...at this price i think it\\'s quite worthy product.1. camera quality is excellent but if you\\'re comparing with dslr or other costly phone than you may be disappointed.2. speed is fine... unless you don\\'t ask for lighting speed..3. gaming .. well i played both offline and online games it\\'s doing pretty well.4. speaker and sounds both are doing well till date.cons.1. yup battery heats sometime but that\\'s not the phone problem as i have noticed ... it\\'s due to network fluctuations and sometimes if you talk while charging ..so you can go for it as it\\'s a budget phone ..i\\'m a moderate user of all the facilities. my honest review after using it for 6 months.1. the processor is too worst, booting of mobile takes 2-3 minutes and always shows an error message, you can\\'t even play small games like subway surfers without struck, you can clearly see a lag in frames.2. it doesn\\'t have turbo charging, it takes 1hr 20mins for a full charge. mobiles with turbo charge will take 40mins. it failed in this aspect also.3. sometimes mobile will auto restart.4. as a usual overheating problemin future, i won\\'t recommend lenovo for my friends i hate this phone. because of touch quality and camera & also os. overall performance is good but battery are not good and turbo chargeing is fake best nice phone, battery life not up to the expectation, having heating problem also very very poor mobile. over all poor ( battery backup, heating, camera average). i suggest this product not buy. best product from lenovo full of great features in such a reasonable price. loved it!!.. thanks to amazon too... screen lock not working properlycamera not good.... bahute hi madarchod hand set hai yeh (1) call k doran slide baar niche aajata h kaan k touch hotehi .(2) light sencer is not work

lenovo....not satisfied with camera at all... it heats up with normal usage also. sim slots don\\'t work properly, not made for reliance jio.... unusual structure of audio jack also.i wish if i could get latest updates to improve camera quality from lenovo.battery back-up is just under average.mustn\\'t buy this..... nice phone it\\'s getting struck some time. and can\\'t able to send mails and upload the docs into mail immediately. it takes so much time. mailing problem screen is very poor, breaks and scratches are easily formed when it falls worst phone and my ratings for this phone...rear

nahi dena chahte hai so don\\'t buy this phone mainly i got this phone for it\\'s dolby atmos and was curious to hear my favorite tracks. but the audio level is so damn low that even my old moto g (1st gen ) sounds 100 times better than this. also battery is draining so damn badly. camera is decent. performance wise it\\'s good for it\\'s money. also the network keeps fluctuating. planning to return the phone if there is no update for it\\'s volume defect. good mobile new nano sim slote tray order best phone in range nice phn... great phone..with tremendous battery life. camera is osume..with 3rd party software does a great job..a valuable investment. thanx amazon... it\\'s very nice for usage. superb why head phone not covered in the order.sound level very low. i brought this phone 6 months ago...do here is the review after using it..i would say .plz don\\'t buy this phone at all...as this is worst performing phone..negatives-1. just falleb from bed and screen broken in small peices...is it fake corning gorrilla???2. come to the performance...i was so upsate... touch dosent perform well...system lags badly... application suddenly closess...takes too much time to open...heating while calling is a major isuue...feels like i have kept hot iron on my ears..stock android is a worst to work with...no customization..less shortcuts... battery dies within 4 hrs....3. camera is also big concern..poor quality pics...wont work sometime..biig disappointment.. here4.music...also not upto the mark...dolby atmos is just like a failure in this mobile.overall...u will get just one thing from this mobile..and thats irritation..so please guys...don\\'t waste your money on this worthless peice.. good phone but looks isn\\'t great.why mediatek always.phone sometimes lag. heating issue is a major factor. i use this since october 2017,only onne problem it heats a lot while charging. worst phone i have ever seenpoor batteryvery slowly chargingslowly functioningheatingnetwork problemnot handy accesscustomer service is not good.i will share it on social networking sites to avoid common public harassment and cheating. worst phone,worst battery life, drained in only 3 hours i was waiting for a smartphone that can give all the features that any other product ain tgus price range would be able to give. when i came across lenovo k8 note, i was surprised with it\\'s features. 4 gb ram and 64 gb rom was a cliche but a deca-core processor was the best thing to have in a smartphone in this price range. overall performance is awesome. don\\'t buy it ,cast option doesn\\'t work in lenovo. i love this phn...that\\'s what i really want...camera quality, battery, display quality, voice quality everything is perfect...happy with this phn😀 this phone is full paisa wasol phone because in this range i dont see any phone like this. i like it\\'s sound quality and camera and more good features like vr spilt dislpay or dolby atom etc. but i disappointed by its heating problem some time it become very hot if we continuously use it for one hour. but battery life is good. according to me it is a good phone. invoice don\\'t deserve a star also legit product - but my earphones aren\\'t fitting properly in the audio jack - although it gives audio feedback correctly. not sure if this is a lenovo thing, or a manufacturing defect very very good quality overall good product. have been using from one month and i think except rear camera and battery backup everything is fine working at this time. nice phone overall,but do not have camera (13mp) as expected, and sometime have heating problem speaker was tear within 4 months, not so good raju sound is not as desired, only one speaker outlet at bottom works battery performance is not upto the mark considering its 4000 mah battery, otherwise a good mobile in this price range :) awesome 1 mobile it is good truly i don\\'t find any cons in this phone. 64gb helps a lot in installing apps which will stay in phone memory. good ram that i can see the apps still stand even if i open it on the next day. camera is amazing. depth mode is good. selfie is bad. the picture quality is not good. very bad when front flash is on. battery backup is very good. turbo charging working very well. bkwas product... 2 din me rula k patak dia isne... network not work properly.. when anybody call me then its show them \"out of coverage\" wat the hell... wifi hotspot error because a lenovo laptop dont connect with lenovo product... so hillarious...amazon service is very good and i thnkful for amazon custmer service for replacement the mobile doesnt have auto call record feature which is normally found in todays feature phones. booked it on may 04 2018 , as usual amazon delivered it by time. here comes the problem just after 10 days the low quality stuff used in this mobile like mother board and processor start troubling me like anything it used to get switch off with loud noise and disturbed display more over heating issue even my iron box doesn\\'t heat up that much. i visited the lenovo store near me they stated that this is happening because of new update, their version is unsatisfactory . i thought i got a faulty one but once i was in to the store then i came to know that almost 9 out of 10 are faulty one\\'s and every customer of lenovo(moto) mourning out in the customer care centers. zabardastt phone,,,bass, size me thoda bada hai,,, worst mobile i have ever seen.i don\\'t like this and i want to suggest all other buyers don\\'t buy this mobile.. it is not user friendly. very bad exp from lenovo phones gets heat up a d software problems. many problem in this mobile wireless display,call recorder display flickering,battery problem wow parking not good. good phone for now it\\'s very good but in coming days don\\'t know how it supports. nice don\\'t trust lenevo.their service are typically chinese service.you can\\'t trust.it will irritate you.build quality is very bad.battery backup is bad.camera is average low battery issues, i want bill worst phone ever by lenovo ..k5 is far better.volte doesn\\'t work. poor signal. alarm only comes by itself . battery charges super slow.i\\'m a fan of lenovo but this phone is a disaster superb i have a problem with network as most of the time my mobile data is not connected even if i am outside where my other phone is showing 4g data.... can lenovo fix this or i have to return the phone? battery not good too good a phone for sub rs. 15 k. fingerprint sensor is very fast. very good camera. very clear music system when headgear used. battery is efficient, for my use it lasts for 2 days. no negatives except that one has to get used to its latest software to play with it. overall design is quite impressive. value for money. updates are not easy and regular as they claim. good phone very much satisfied killer note, but it is only killing me. frustrated and highly disappointed. i am writing this after 2 month usage, nothing great to tell about the phone. just an another note serious from lenova, the specification looks great on paper and in reality everything sucks.it gets heated up even for normal usage, the battery drains faster than normal mobiles, it is not a 4000mah battery for sure.the camera looks good not better. don\\'t zoom it while taking long shots. th picture quality is not up to the mark.it does not behave like 4gb ram, it rather responds like 2gb ram and gets jammed frequently.i have installed many apps and after getting the phone slowed down, i have removed most of the aps.guys, the price was reduced but still, you shall go for a better brands like moto, mi, samsung. the phone is good but camera is not up to mark for photo loving guys i\\'ve wasted my money by buying this smartphone. it\\'s video recording quality is worst. i\\'ve purchased this phone specially for it\\'s camera but they made me fool. really sad. faced charginga and heat issue after only

day!doesn\\'t gets hang!camera lags sometimes!dolby!😍 hand set high weat battery is draning very fast.. following i found with this phone after 2days usage:1. cast (screen mirroring) not working2. battery drains fast3. battery charging time very high.4. heating more5. camera quality very bad.my old lenovo k5 note for more better than this phone.(lenovo k8 note) hi sir mobile battery backup low... not satisfied fake promotion (killer🤔) battery drain so quickly after updating. battery back up is low cool phone except for battery draining issue.rest is fine. good phone poor battery worst just like a labour class product.... after one month of use with k8 it\\'s good phone in this range, mean while i would like to share some negative sides, compare to samsung j7 battery backup is not so gud , even sumsung has only 3000 mah it\\'s backup is better than k8 4000 mah, screenshot facility is available in power button, but we have to change the option from settings musik key.... camera is fine and hd quality but we can\\'t blur the baground images as like lenovo vibe s1....due to curved screen tempered glass will not fix properly.... it\\'s a totally dummy fake phones and cheating with the customer simply amazing i am not sure why people are writing bad reviews but my take is value for money. best mobile at this range. camera is not upto the mark weight more but other future are good. everything is nice but back camera is very very bad bkvas the phone i received looked like a refurbished one. it\\'s not x23 chipset but x20 which is an older variant. camera quality is not at all good. cpu runs at 40 to 50 percent even when kept in idle mode. ram optimization is not there, so you will get less free ram for your usage. god knows why! anyway, the technical department agreed to refund the money. good phone at a low budget. maha sara hua hai phone hai bhai bhul se v mat lena koi battery drain very fast camera v bakwaas hai aur heat v bhaut hota hai very bad product

reviews, but i am so disappointed. i don\\'t know if this is an issue with my handset or if this is common for all phones, but mine has major heating issues.it doesn\\'t connect to the wifi smoothly.camera quality is just about okay and the speaker works fine.the battery lasts for a day, but then it feels better to put the phone down rather than use it, so....it could have been a good budget phone under 15k but the heating makes it impossible to even hold the phone after a whilei\\'m stuck with this phone now as they don\\'t seem to be accepting this model for exchange :( nice phone...good overall. but camera should be better...and most importantly i want fast updates.. best mobile at this price. with finger sensor , 4gb ram 64 gb memory 5.5 inch and stylish battery backup prblm..and accessories are missing awsome product nice mobile very poor phone best phones of the category, unmatchable specs ! nice phone.!i was scared of heating issues before buying the phone.but

three times software updated by lenovo authorized service center. still product under warranty. purchased nov\\'17.if you attend any voice call hot air is blowing from the speaker with in 2 mins. lenovo unable to neither solve the issue nor ready to replace the mobile. so amazon should have control in replacement in warranty period. lenovo service center are useless. my strong suggestion is do

starts heating up and draining the batteries further fast.phone does not get charged by any other charger, except supplied by lenovo.i suggest not to buy this product. various other options are available in the market at this price or better price. wrost product wasted my money wanted to return but unable to do so wrorst experience with amozon super product with great performance. good phone good one but getting hot while using net for long time i have done order with the no-coast emi but bank taking regularly rate of interest on amount. also i am unable to connect your telephonic executive overall it\\'s an ok device. i gave it to a friend and he complaint about heating and charging issues at first but now after reformatting it, it is going on quite good. so it can be called as a decent device. and these kind of issues usually occur when the phones are sold via sales so. good phone afterall. nice product for this cost nice phone, good picture quality n also good battery. i\\'m using from 3 months there is no problem with this phone😇 but one camera at back won\\'t work it\\'s not dual camera super pathetic device...i have used multiple phones of lenovo...this is one of the worst in terms of performance. never expected this. i used to be a huge fan of lenovo phones,this time they have drastically embarrassed me. i spoke to amazon rep and they checked the temperature, which was 45 degree celsius, and per the rep it was normal. someone tell them 45\\' is overheating, and the irony is you are stuck with this device, you cannot ask for refund. it\\'s a cheating and government should do something about it. everything is bad right from performance to camera to heating to hardware. poor service form lenova after the purchased super config phone within 12k budget... working well so far.. :) phone is good ,camera quality is also good,it works better than samsung or mi phones but the only problem i faced is with the battery,inspite of having 4000mah battery it\\'s hardly last for 14 hours ,i am using jio lte sim,and with ds it only last for 14-15 hours.if you use internet the battery drains so fast 35%of battery drains within 2 hour. battery drain problem bad while charging over heating awesome good looking phone best nothing wrong upto now. it\\'s a nice product from lenovo. cameras are quite good. regarding speed it\\'s faster than others of this kind.but the only thing is that there is no idea about the second rear camera, how it works.after all it\\'s very good till now killer phone from lenovo delivery was good and performance was excellent only bad thing is secondary camera and slow motion 4k recording capability was not there build quality and pure andriod experience is very good, battery backup is ok ok.. but main issue i faced is network fluctuation on the phone every second changing to 2g, 3g & 4g even in well covered area..call quality was poor hence returned and got refunded. nice you are dalivare is lata 24hours hangs a lot when on whatsapp and other applications. worst phone...camera is not good. it is very nice fone battery backup bis poor, no fast charge , heating all day without use everything is good expect battery life. fantastic product the phone is heating without any reason and the charging is very slow.turbo charger is not working properly. nice phone with good reviews on internet and bought. the product worth for money and feel the reviews are really true. received lenovo k8 note on 10th october, phone worked fine till 19th october, could not be turned on after charging. dead.taken to the service centre on 21st, informed that there is a hardware problem ,probably motherboard and will take a week to10 days for repair.disappointed.dont think will buy a lenovo product again. batter ,but

and duel camera not work properly and also not having video call option plz dont go for it. battery backup is utter worst,even though its mentioned 4000mah, getting hardly 4hours without data and getting 4hours time to get the full charge inspite of turbo charger. getting lot of heat all the time. utter worst battery backup and the power charging. 0 rating nice performance. cemera results also good but i have to learn how to use professional mode. battery backup also good. performance and speed both well. wonderful product. i\\'m satisfied. a very good phone with excellent features at a very genuine price. battery is so poor not charging fastly and it drained so earlycamera also not good as they advertised battery issue and searching a screen guard is difficult task for this dont order this.total fail mobile.cant work camera while charging i lifted it for receiving a call but was so hot that it slipped from my hand and broken the screen just from the height of 2- 3 feet. not good. .. the phone is good its quality is good, it have various features, but the network of the phone is not good it always loses network of the sim. best phone this price product is good but its battery back not well as it\\'s have 4000mah. after that its start hanging when you play any game on it. its have 4gb ram. nice product i got defected charging usb inside the package box,its not charging. the mobile is overheated and its little bit bend automatically so i have contacted the lenovo customer care in online chat they simply said me its problem in manufacturer defect and so don\\'t go this mobile handset does not catch signal properly-- hence returning same--also it goes in to do not disturb mode even when standing near a mobile tower..should better go with some other brand good performance very good value for money.. bluetooth of mobile is not connecting with its paired devices. worst mobile ever i brought till date. not getting phone network since i started using it. not sure whom to contact and return policy date is also over. amazing product.. the only con according to me is that the display is blank even when the caller calls you. lenovo k8 note doesnt show up the display automatically at the time of receiving call, we have to press the button to see the caller\\'s name/number. good phone ,, overall performance is good,,,nice camera(front&rear) in day light but has poor low light performance,, rear flash is not up to d mark.battery backup may bother u to some extent in case if ur a heavy gamer/user,,except these 2 issues(camera& batterybackup) everything is good.heating issue is with everyphone if v run many app simultaneously & expect good performance then it drains d battery which leads to heating.thanks amazing it\\'s too fast worst phone i have ever been purchased, don\\'t bye any lenovo phone not good....dont buy some status bar missing in this devicenetwork speed are missingso i m rating 4this phone is good superb value for money good looking phone with all the necessary features available. the camera is good and sound quality is also ok.no headphones along with phone in the box. on screen mirroring sportearphone sound

performance guys don\\'t go for this. amazon has fake return policy now. you can\\'t even return the product in any case.camera quality is not good as they described in ad. its a normal camera .sound quality is also very poor.not worth as per price.installed apps are also very basic apps. worst sms app i ever used .. i worst mobile.....redmi note 4 bomb is far better.....charging takes 4-5 hrs then what is the use of turbo charging.....photos also not good....alot of heat is emitting when compared to redmi....i felt very sad....am going to return my mobile..... nice and genuine product fantastic screen cast does not work, and when complained to lenovo, suggested to buy a chrome cast and use the screen cast, which i suggest to add a patch in android make it work directly as i was happy to use lenovo k5 note and its screen cast.also i do not see any significant change in 400 ah battery vs 3500 mah battery in k5 note. suggest for improving the same.torch light is natural which is yellowish in nature, is the led designed such way or is their any issue as same light appears whiter when it works as flash, while taking a photo best phone and operating system too good too poor camera quality as lenovo committed that 13+5 mp rear camera while zoom on 1x level image quality will be getting worst according to tap on little bit zoom,so poor quality as well as after taking snaps pixel quality also worst on zooming image.i ruined my 14 k bucks on this nonsense thing. camera quality excellent...heating problem starts if using back cover.back cover needs to remove to avoid heating problem. nice ok the battery backup is less then 6 hours and it drains very very fast. for 10k i did not see this much feature nice phone we can buy this phone excellent mobile all are good. no disappointment on this phone. all questions will be in heat on mobile. there is no heat while using. but the heat occur when charging mobile and using at same time. so don\\'t use phone while charging.turbo charger great plus. don\\'t ever buy this phoneit\\'s been 8 month i\\'m using this mobile.now it\\'s automatically restarting can\\'t even use the mobile. it\\'s not even turning on.it\\'s heating like anythingwent to lenovo care for warranty issuethey r like can\\'t get warranty for this kind of stuffplease don\\'t go for this phone. very good product battery backup and camera is not much good...but the quality of the display is worthy...good performance while ordering lenovo k8 note, it was written that the box contains 2 turbo charger, but i found only 1 charger. please send one more charger it\\'s very good phone. performance is up to expectation. good good one nice mobile. i am a big fan of lenovo. good processor, great memory. even style is good. camer ; both excellentprocesser ; nicebut only problem is battery slightly warm after 1 - 2 hrs used n its stand by 1 day.... worst product from lenovo till date. the hand set has issues from the date of purchase. issues faced are as under and can be an eye opener for the prospective buyers:1. hang-up during usage - very often you are left stranded in between apps as phone hangs-up in between usage like checking whatsapp, email of sms2. heats up excessively - the claim of fast charging is false. it takes almost 5 hours for full charge. heats up even while making calls and drains battery quite fast. the battery doesn\\'t last even 5 hours post full charge3. battery - the claim on turbo charge is false. there is no fast charging and it takes 5-6 hours for full charge. heats up even while making calls and drains battery quite fast. the battery doesn\\'t last even 5 hours post full charge4. access to common functions - doesn\\'t even have access to common functions like providing sms service centre number. have recently taken the handset to a lenovo service centre, even they didn\\'t know, how to put in the sms service centre number.5. lenovo forum - unlike other leading or even lesser known brands, lenovo executives don\\'t respond to the queries/issues put up on the forum.over all very bad product to choose. my issue how to dispose the same.regardscertified buyer vrygood doesn\\'t fit lenovo k8 note awesome phone...must buy i did not receive head phone in box .. headphones accessory is missing and camera clarity of this phone is pethetic the phone display got damaged within 7 months of usage and the service center has declined the warranty stating there is an internal damage to the display. i asked them to open the phone and show the internal damage to that i can accept their statement, for which they are not ready. they say even if they open they can\\'t show the damage. even after escalating the issue, the issue is not resolved and they are not ready to honor the warranty. better to go for accidental damage coverage if you are going with this phone. camera achaa hai processer achaa hai bs kmi battry me hai ekdm bekar chalti hai i m not happy with lenevo not k8 i want to return this product please help amazon guys this phone is superior in hardware buylt its software has major shortcomings. lenovo k3/k4 users should not buy this phone considering the performance of those phones. the software part misses some functions which makes it an below average phone for day to day use :con\\'s- phone\\'s design is rectangular so it does not fits perfectly in hand and feels heavier- no option to save contacts in phone memory , only gmail a/c contacts support which makes contacts and call logs and messages laggy. it lags wherever you require to get contact from contacts.- their is no option to disable vibration on call connect- its mono loud speakers sound is loud but quality is like cheap chinese phone ,its not like k3 - k4 notepro\\'s- good battery backup - 4 star for it- screen resolution, colors & touch screen is very smooth - 5star for them- good processor works faster and better. but phones seems laggy due to poor hardware software coordinationi will not recomend to buy this phone, instead go for samsung phones as their software is always balanced nice phone , battery backup is also good as well as speaker ,but the camera is not that much better in single mode it\\'s betterbut in duel or depth mode it\\'s badbut the performance of the phone is outstandingno issue with heavy gaminga good phone for gaming and soundno issue after update very bed very poor product...it\\'s take 5 to 6 hours to charge..and discharge so fast..it\\'s also hitting problem..one camera out of dual frant camera also not working..it\\'s looking like dummy cameragorilla galss also so poor it\\'s break easily amazing phone, value for money productbest brand, budget phone such amazing featurestoo good camera, no company can give such best product in this price. gifted this smartphone to my parents. one soft gold and another venom black.. both devices are fantastic in terms of processing speed, camera and audio quality... even the touch and fingerprint sensor also have a good feel and response.only thing i did not like is the volume and power buttons. these keys are very hard to press.. problem with charging (too slow) and heating up battery no auto call recorderno chargering percentage in battery symbol very nice heating during charging, not user friendly, camera quality average compared to camera specification nice phone at this price...the most i like is the dolby atmos gd phone nice user frendly operation sensible buy nice battery charges very late.while charging it heat up.my friend got the same product but the product was defective .when they ordered for replacement till now they r not replied. good display. upon unlocking ,the screen does not respond sometimes. contacts can not be saved. saved names get lost after some time and you see only the no. i doubt batt. is 4000 mah. buy considering this. big warning! never ever buy this product. amazon was great in delivering the product in great packaging and it was an original product when i bought it in sept 17. but after using for months, i just regret buying it. battery does not last for more than 5-6 hours, keeps on hanging and takes a lot time in saving pics. being 64 gb and decacore, it was supposed too run smoothly, but it\\'s a waste piece. my sony m2 phone was much better than this. even after using for four years, runs perfectly. never buy lenovo phones. usable... it\\'s not like more than lenovo k5 note. as per expecting his battery & camera also features is very poor & disappointed to purcheser😕. i want return my k8 if any one interested pls contact me🤔 product is good but sometime software issue found like apps stopped working, system ui has stopped and death enable mode not working properly super... i like it.. tq amazon...@raj not good camera quality is good internal only 51gb battery is decreasing so much ordered fine gold but receive vetnom black. phone has average phone in this price mobile is heating at working time awesome product with good built quality. dolby atmos sound is really great, no heating issues so far (using it for two weeks) , the battery power is amazing. the camera is really good. yesit\\'s a nice phone best mobile in this category good mobile with super fast delivery lenovo k8 note is very awesome phone in all department i love my phone i am using it for

lenovo k 8 note...bt only one problem is there that there is only one sound is working...bt product is good awesome worst ever mobile from lenovo.cast screen not working.hike voice call note working.heat very soon.dual camera is garbage.why should i buy this phone. heating issuecall drop super its very nice mobile...the camera& its speed really good... the screen was damaged so where is replace super i am quite happy , with the performance absolutely horrendous battery life. the phone is good and works well but the battery runs out in no time and to make things worse the phone doesn\\'t charge fast for some reason so it takes hours for the phone to get charged. not expected from lenovo, have been using their devices for a long time and never had a problem earlier but this product is pathetic. not a value for money as it does not support voltecamera quality is really bad when compare to lenova k4 note vibei brought lenova k8 note based on expectation lenova k4 note vibe that it will be more better than lenova k4 note vibebut lenova k8 note is worst than all lenova seriesnot at a value for money super smartphone nice phone. battery is an issue. will not last more than a day at average use, even though it is 4000 mah. camera is not great but good. i want to repurchase my order . this mobile is heating very much performance wise no other phone will beat it under the price range of 25kbut only i was disappointed with it camera work during low light... handset features are good but if u used the internet or played a game, it becomes too much heated. pros:performancestock androidmetal body(hard to break survive without any damge even fallen on concrete floor from 7 ft height)audio qualitycons:heatingcamerabattery backup (better battery needed,with 10 core processor 4000mah is too low) battery backup is just about a day, much less than my expectations. i had a lenovo p70 previously whose battery was also 4000mah but used to last more than a day comfortably.secondly , there is no gallery to store photos , memo pad or custom message settings which all samsung devices have.thirdly, the camera has begun to hang after two weeks of use such a stupid device. soo much heating problem in this phone value for money... don\\'t expect too much from camera this phone gives you all advanced features at low price but it has 4 problems1) heating2) battery backup is low3) beep sound comes suddenly4) mediatek processor is not working properlyi do not think it will work for more days. very bad battery back up. worst quality. i will never buy smart

one pc\\'s receive.. good phone bad camera, great performancei\\'m not one to write lengthy reviews of products, but here i felt the need to get a few points out there, because the lenovo k8 note isn\\'t all that it promises to be, but it\\'s definitely not an average product either.point is, i bought this phone to replace my redmi note 3, 3gb and 32gb. i have an s7 edge as my primary driver, i\\'ve always kept a second phone to game and watch videos. the other options i had considered were the honor 6x and the honor 8 lite. the reason i went with lenovo k8 note was for the dual camera setup and a good industry reviews on performance. it wouldn\\'t hurt that my backup phone had a dual camera setup to play around with some bokeh fun. here\\'s my thoughts after using the phone as my primary phone for the past 3 days.performance:this phone is everything that every review claims it to be. yes it has a mediatek processor but this deca-core setup with 4gb ram and 64gb memory is phenomenal. in my experience, this phone handles multi-tasking as good as my s7 edge. i was playing guns of boom, wwe champions, youtube video and facebook all at the same time, and over a period of 45 minutes, the phone switched between these apps without a single glitch or delay. wwe champions was open when i locked my phone. when i picked it back up afetr 20 odd minutes, i found the screen exactly where i left and it loaded the game without a seconds delay. if you want this phone for casual gaming and media, its just a pleasure to use.camera:in all fairness, the dual camera setup on the k8 note requires a lot of polishing. its nowhere near as good as the honor 6x. the depth detection feature is very erratic. it works like a charm under good and day light, but try using it indoors and in the evening you\\'ll either be left with hazy photos lacking sharpness or pictures that have been focused in the wrong areas. the front 13 mp camera is good for casual selfies though.one thing though, put the flash on and both the front and the back cameras return stellar results. the bokeh effects and the depth editor functions may not work as well as they should, but if you manage to keep a steady hand and get a good shot from the dual camera setup, then playing around with the options can be fun. changing background and focus are fun options. (check photos)battery, ui, build and valuethe battery backup is great to say the least. i tested it by playing a graphic intensive modern combat 5 for 2.5 hours straight and the battery dropped from 100 to 50. the casual day with some gaming, social media and calling etc takes the phone to 30-20 per cent max by 12 in the night.the phone comes with a clear / transparent plastic case installed on the phone. since there aren\\'t any good choices for a k8 note cover, this preinstalled one serves the purpose, but it is scratch prone. just the second day it had dozens of scratches. (check the photo)the all metallic build of the phone looks and feel very premium. the black colour has a nice matte finish too. but the back love fingerprints and gets a smudge very easily. (check photo) its best to use a black armour / cover when they become available.the best part of the k8 note is the stock android ui. that ensures the k8 note is smooth and perfectly functional. its a snappy phone alright. the finger print sensor works like a charm on both hands, it picks up even the most obscure touches.final word:i would definitely recommended the k8 note. in terms of sheer performance, this phone is a pleasure. its like a tuned up ktm engine. it may not have the most appeasing specs but the performance is all throttle and torque friendly. sadly, the camera is below average to be frank. either lenovo push through some tuneups or the buyers will have to keep their photography ambitions under a strict check. not bad, battery not working as 4000mah camera bad working like 2mp need update depth mode. india ka no 1 phone isse behtar aaj ki date me kuch bhi nahin hai mobile is good but giving three stars because accidentally when my mobile fell down the glass was broken and now i\\'m not able to use it because in market till now no parts are available for it. very delicate glass... nyc product only battery problem and idea promo not activate what is the

earlier users before buying any product. one hell of a device it is....best mid-range smartphone it is... definitely recommended amazing product.camera- fantastic both front & rear.connectivity-super, look- very good. heating problem- no issue as compared to its previous versions. second peas your product was faulty and i asked for replace u r just engaging me in rubish things... ... . do this then do that... ... . at last nothing happened good phone in all respects , but slightly sluggish camera autofocus . really good phone, other than the dual camera software... i am using this for quite some time now so thought of reviewing it.everything is as per specifications given ...so i am not wasting ur time writing all those again lets gets straight to the pros and consadv1) processor works fast so there is less chance of the pg one to get hanged2) battery backup is quite large as it has 4000mah battery3) front cam is ok4)charging is super fast i must say......but with time after a few years this speed will gradually decrease thats the problem with lenovo phones5) overall its okdisadvantages1) the back camera quality is not as it has been advertised....i would say it gives clear images ofcourse but it takes a long time to focus and adjust....i mean pretty long time to get ur perfect image which u desire2) even though it has a 4000 mah battery still i dont find any difference with the 3000/3500 mah batterys....the discharge is samei think by now u hv got the idea that its a ok type phone not great......i am also using lenovo vibe k5 note for a year now......all the configerations r same just the battery is a 3500mah one and it has a single back camera thats it.........so i would say lenovo vibe k5 note is far better than this......atleast i felt it in these couple of months.......u can give it a try after all u always hv the option of returning on amazon.....so all the bestif u found my review helpful dont forget to give a like ......thankssss and happy shopping is bad product net using time very high heating. excellent its balanced phn in all features.the main thing is the helio x23 processor is too better than snapdragon 625 and also battery efficient.camera is giving best results. its the best choice. nice mobile bay mobile worst experience ever with amazon bcoz of lenovo who degrade amazon valuation, gives me defective peice good phone at the price it\\'s being offered. not a great camera and display but has a good ram and storage. dedicated sd card slot is a big plus. not many phones offer this now. camera image quality is below average but good at this price point.real value for money. battery performance is poor. after using 10 day it has changing problem .takes 5 to 6 hours to full charge . very bad in catching signal...always says out of range feature is good but only one speaker worksno gallery in the phone this phone worked well in india but did not work in us. att and tmobile frequencies do not match. att is did not work at all. with tmobile only voice works. should not have bought this phone. it\\'s a good phone but there are some issues with the camera the camera cannot adjust the exposer so the image are more whitish and not real i hope this will be fixed via a system update but if want a perfect mobile with everything balance and your budget is 15k then u can take mi a1subscribe my youtube channel named asdc technical it\\'s was great your product but now i\\'m to able to contact with u for my complian gst detail update on my invoice copyi had two times contact coustermer care no one person can give positive feedback about. the mobile has some good features. but charging is very slow. (nearly 4 hours) initially there were problems with volte (jio) connectivity. jio was good for internet, but calls and messaging did not work on this handset. the same jio sim worked well in another 4g handset. with software update, this issue the camera doesn\\'t start sometimes and i had to restart the mobile. restarting this mobile also takes a long time compared to other mobiles. lenovo has to seriously fix these issues. my experience with this phone has been mixed. the good thing about the phone is the 1080p resolution. the videos look crisp, so you can watch youtube , netflix , prime and enjoy the visuals.the sound is not loud enough, even adding a headphone does not help much, unless it has an amplifier. you will have problems while receiving calls because the incoming volume is low. i called up the customer case and they asked me to do a factory reset. did not help.the touch screen gets laggy after some time.i have enough spare storage and even when no apps are running, i can feel the lag. another irritation is while holding the phone the touchscreen gets touched and results in unintentional clicks. i have purchased lennovo k8 but the mobile not switched on but heat.there is no response our complaint,custmore care is not responding.feed back immediately??????????. very good product really happy with this productcan any guide to cast screen very good phone ,having very good camera , battery back up is good , and no heating issues not worth for buying. lack many key features which was their in k5 or 6 note. also mobile heats like an oven even if used for 1 hour and battery backup is pathetic. very bad phone from lenovo battery draining fastly and mobile heat up even of 5 min normal gaming. network never shows full and shows no signal after some time.camera deapth mode is not so good as mentioned by the lenovo.complete wastage of money worst camera quality for both front & back. not satisfied with the product. fast charging in just 90 minutes only. do not buy this product.in just 6 months i had to pay rs. 2000 for servicing.battery drains faster than it gets charged.does not even provide adequate standby time, 20 - 25 % battery gets drained overnight and the phone just gets switched off even when no background application is running and the network is off. no auto-brightness option. 55 - 60% ram is always occupied no matter whatever i do to clear it and the phone lags even in simple games like subway surfers.with all the features advertised and at this price range, it is frustrating. worth it. aug 2017- best config on this date for this price the battery performance of the mobile is like 2500mah capacity.. screen on time is just average (4hrs)... rear camera is good and selfie camera tooo good... performance is excellent.. dolby atmos is average. nothing in particular such a waste of money....don\\'t buy this handset, i\\'m trying to return this.... worst mobile. i suggest pls go for other mobiles.two major issue 1) heats up and 2) battery drain fast. getting very heat, battery getting very weak within 10 hours with out using data connet good camera, decent battery life, selfie camera great, biggest problem is sms send failure, you can\\'t recognize u\\'r device, so online banking impossible, already inform lenovo. let\\'s hope it will be solved asap. cash back not credited for this purchase yet. product is good. in this mobile the gorilla glass is duplicate after some time use purchase date 24/01/2018 glass is broken on corner side liked the product. amazing features, seamless performance, good build quality and most important reasonably priced. best phone i have ever had lenovo k8 having turbo chargingbut it works automatically sometime it’s charge in 1.25 hrs and sometime it take more than 2 hrs..heavy weight of 180 grmperformance of rear camera is not too much good in low light conditions and rear camera performance also one problem sometime you will see blurred images no subject is in focus.and one main disadvateage is battery is draining fast cannot use one day full .. bettery choise is any other phone very bad not upto the mark not satisfied with it\\'s performance.hanging is the big disadvantage of this phone... phone is very good but data cable is very bad quality network not good, sim is not working properly.mobile have no eye protection.without eye protection screen light is bad for eye super nice nyc phone great experience with this amazing product from lenovo.it is equipped with almost every features that a smartphone would require.decacore processor,long lasting battery and 64 kb internal memory with 4gb ram is just awesome.i would certainly recommend this phone for users having heving usage and game lovers. osm mobile... 4*deducted due tovvery poor battery performance... drains in 2.5hrs... only... got the device yesterday.from first charge itself the charger makes loud hissing noise continuously during charging this device, but no noise while charging other devices. similarly no noise comes when charged this device using another charger. now i\\'m using the old lenovo charger instead of the new one.#2 many software issues :dolby atmos is not working.clock is not getting updated while on call.sometimes native app itself opens twice. camera result is not more expected that i thought.. lenovo k8 note does not seem to support screen cast. you can cast you tube videos but you can\\'t cast amazon prime videos. the device or the os seems to have a bug and does not recognize my smart tv when i try to cast. i checked online for solutions and lenovo says to use chromecast thus asking us to buy that indirectly. don\\'t buy this phone. also it is not taking screenshot even though i tried the steps they have written. also it doesn\\'t recognize my ear phones which works perfectly with other lenovo phones. faulty device. don\\'t buy. this product is good for use and features are satisfing according to price overall good phone early warm up and slow down. phone is very nice but packing is very third class when i open tha box my phone and back cover have some scratches feeling bad for it best value for money, lovely design, and form factor with good configuration. bought it for my father in law, he is very much satisfied. go ahead and buy it. worst phone, i changed it with mi a1.bad camerabad youtubebad gpu ( i thought it would be good but nope) very poor battery back up......just rubbish if you are thinking or considering this phone. i simply say buy it.! best for the prize. u hardly find and difference between this and moto g5splus. yes very minor issues. but literally you hardly notice them or use them. buy it to save money. using this from three months. im halpy with it. this product has battery problem..it is draining too much battery in few minutes battery is draining very poor. after 30% battery mobile will switch off immediately. its battery life is very poor and jio network also not come properly it is not possible to put both the 4g sim cards at a time everything is great in this phone but problem in doing casting as it does not support screen mirroring but for casting you need a same wifi network which is connected to your phone and with your smart led tv battery performance is not up to the mark. weight toda jada phone ka very very good phone.no heating issue. long lasting battery.gaming is as smooth as butter.no lag.sound quality is aswome...screen quality is really good.call quality is also good.amazon is the best. as i\\'m a business man this mobile is very useful because it\\'s battery charge lasts for longer hours. nice phone is product me to cash back milne wala tha wo kaise milega i am using last 15 days... but not good for mobile.. low memory space.... i am not using more apps but low space the memory... internet on lightly hang the mobile..... so not good for memory space more app installed. and hang to on internet... how to problem solved... heated up so much that my glass get cracked gr8 future with great price. product is not good as per the aspection. at this cost lots of mobile available with a very good quality.1. heavy in wait.2. second back care is useless , only use for depth mode.3. cast screen mirroring not available . lots of other problems on the phone .major problems i faced in there is no shaprate gallery available . all photos and vedio saved in google photos .totally wastage of money this phone . living up to my expectations device remains hot, even when kept in the pocket it keeps heating up. big battery issue, as bettery last long for 15 hours max without any heavy usage. no turbo charging as mentioined in thw ad. it take around 4 hours for full charge. be careful.... the device was poor quality product by lenovo... this phone is good but sometimes when i open gallery the screen of my phone is suddenly turn into white blank screen and there is only one way to get out of this situationis to press your power button (turn of your screen) then start your phone again.the camera of this phone is averageotherwise battery was awesome..... very good horrible experience, had to return on the same day, very bad phone, promised technician vist never came. keep away from this phone. it does not have emi dedicated volte built in currently gold standard for any phone these days. price and handset absulately ok ek dum jabrdast hai ! lenovo ke jaisa konsa bi nai hai phone........ superb lenovo company buhat kurab hai mc bc sab ha sal kabi maat lena goods, great camera clrearity however few features to be implemented i.e. cropping the pics. bahut bekar hai everything is awesome.camera is killer.but i got cheated by amazon in battery quality.its batry not luks like 4000mah.its draining like 1500 or 2000 mah fone.otherwise everything is good. excellent phone our mobile is mistec phone gets too much heat (even if you do not use internet or play videos)even u can\\'t hold it in your hands as the device gets too warm and now i should go to lenovo service center as the phone is taking 5 hrs to fully charge and no battery backup worst phone. my hands are becoming so warm by holding this stupid phone. guys please don\\'t buy this phone don\\'t encourage lenovo and amazon shame on u for selling this fraudulent phones this phone is very bad , not sport well jio network and not work fast charging and very hitting problem. not buy this phone. the perfect phone..everthing in the phone is totally fine and awesome only the problem is battety backup while you are not using your phone ......this review ia after using the phone for 2 months. i got good product in good condition . best budget phone. good camera. good features. loved it good it\\'s superb can\\'t set preferred ring tones from sd card or others. only a few in-built ring tones can be used. mobile is ok but service by amazon team very poor so i plan close my amazon account and going for some other e-commerce site do not buy it its charger will start creating problem very soon and phone too have not good battery back up as mentioned. it\\'s voice starting to get low within two months of use. worst of sprnding such amount. my opinion after using phone .. pros:- turbo feature, 4000 mah battry, 13 mp camera , dual camera setup, fingerprint is too fast , processor is very very fast........... cons:- battry backup is bad , rear camera is too bad and weight is too heavy ...... in 64 gb storage u will get only 50gb which is so bad ..... speaker is useless . actually i love lenovo...i have used k5note and impressed. but ki note is not up to the mark. excellent phone, all premium features at an affordable price. i got it in just over 9k in amazon sale 😎 nice phone, but redme note 4 (my old phone) seems more user friendly as it has inbuilt dual app feature, battery % and data speed display and more handy... good product xcellent value for money headphones missing in box... still confused related mobile.. amazing phone. performance good gehdjdid the phone working is fine.. only turbo charging questionable coz it still takes 2hrs to full charge the phone.. otherwise 4.5 stars.. nice mobile with great performance, awesome battery backup and dash charging. the camera quality is also great only want portrait mode as it has dual camera also. 5* for cameras, the cameras are really good the pictures are clear and perfect. front camera with flash is really a good thing. the depth mode wasn\\'t working perfectly, but after few updates it was rectified.1* for its turbo charging, it takes 2.5 hrs to charge it\\'s battety from 30-100.1* for its volte, does not support jio voice calls. after 2 calls volte wont work.5* for its dolby, it has a very good quality of sound but volume can be improved.4* for its fully metallic body, its quite heavy but good slim attractive look3* for its battery, because for this smartphone 4000mah is not sufficient.5* for its fingerprint sensor, it is quick in recognising the finger imprints.3* for its processors, processors are good but it takes a little bit of time to load some applications.the main thing which really disappointed me was-does not support volte(it\\'s 4g volte isn\\'t permanent it\\'s switches on and off whenever the phone wishes. if volte goes off you should restart your phone, again after placing two calls you must again restart to continue voice calls through volte that is through jio sim.)-turbocharging does not work, it takes more time to charge.(if you plug in your phone at 30%, to reach 100% it takes at least two hours.) nice absolutely amazing performance.. best phone so far by lenovo bad mobail full chaina met please don\\'t buy this phone on 16th day of purchase phone stopped working spoke to amazon they refused to help went to service center they said mother board is faulty & needs replacement which takes 25days so please avoid . charging problem full heating its heating like anything and having battery issue and battery backup is also not good. very very bad mobile i m very upset with this i found many problems for this mobile 1.bluetooth not attach properly 2.hotspot not working to desktop computer. 3.only sim one 4 g network sim 2 is only 2/3 g. 4.camra back second not working properly.. good but not best very bad smart phone because of network connectivity is very very slow, no volty support. poor performance but camera is average. i am not happy. please don\\'t buy this phone. good this phone have to much heating problems. this phone produce too much heat. and phone temperaturegoes to 44-45°c.i want to replace this phone cool gadgetbut gets hot while charging...cool features.....👌👌👌👌 call volume not working heating problem waste of money wonderful mobile set. very cute & slim. paisa vasul. i have an issue with the battery, phone getting overheat during calls & while charge. later all display cracked. poor signal strength, battery heat-( i have checked by amazon technician) back key option is not working properly, even i tried to return to amazon. but amazon is not allowing return option. very bad experience this time from amazon. really bad. don\\'t buy this series of lenovo. good battery life, tall and broad, quick!! no latency while toggling between applications. very poor mobile good works it overheats hang hoto wasted my 14k for this mobile... not even 1year passed this phone suck up.... speaker problem... phone hanging... battery drain... doesn\\'t have a one good quality to buy this phone.. please don\\'t recommend this to any one... battery problem very good. no comments. its the most useless phone of the century, neither the keypad nor the charger works perfectly. phone hangs up frequently even it has 4gb ram. the turbo charging mode takes longer time than normal. don\\'t understand why lenovo made such a stupid device. a6000 series was far better than this quality no professional good good phone i bought lenovo k8 note.company show/told you can payment form sbi debit card then you have to 10 % cash back of skinny good i want change settings how settings will change excellent product with excellent service. amazing i brought this phone for dolby atmos feature but i am not satisfied, less volume in head phones and only one speaker work...heating issue....it heats a lot ...charging takes a lot of time and battery drains fast..its not 4000mah it\\'s 2000 mah....camera at this price range is waste....not worthy.....pls don\\'t buy ... amazing product for its price, a must buy suggestion to others. worst experience. never expected this from lenovo. received defective product. notification light blinks only for text messages. jio sim issues are there. after turning off screen, call does not connect. keyboard stops working. superb phone. great phone,super fast,great camera,great sound quality,64 gb is sufficient space good product i did mistake to buy this product.really bad and not to suggest to bought anyone.hanging problem and two times visit to service center in last 3-4 months.i will rate -5 * worth its price really i liked it so much. very bad mobile.battary discharging very fast. i order this phonebut not good battery backupsingle spicer on this phonesecond spicer and second rear camera only sow not warking good mobile with in budget decent camera and battery life phone is very good .bokeh effect needs to be improve.good battery performance. picture quality is very good. charging time around 2 hr. it is a balanced phone . battery back up is very very poor i bought this product on october 2017now in may 2018 its stopped charging the battery even though i am using the same charger provided with this phone by company... don\\'t go with it actually i purchased this product for camera only. but photograph taken by this phone either in day light or low light condition are extremely bad. whoever purchasing this for camera i will say my experience is not good with this model. other features are good. very unhappy with the phone.lenovo claims it to have gorilla glass but its not true. glass quality is worst than the normal lcd display of a 5000rs range phone. its 1 month since i bought the phone and the screen cracked when the phone fell from just the dining table.not happy with the phone.fake gorilla glass. highly recommended to not buy the phone.... best phone in sub 15 k category good product.everything is perfect in this phone when compared with its price. it,s nice one.but software futures need to add more options. have been using k4 note for over an year & half. very satisfied with that. k8 with nougat os is marginally better on overall performance but seriously low on user customization. audio level of speaker and headphone a big letdown. awesome stay away from this phone, signal quality is not just bad - it is a fail; k-series finally has brought in the disease that finished motorola; k8 note says on the back that it is made by moto mobility. i have had 3 k3 notes, 2 k4 notes & 1 k5 note; all good phones; k4 note is an excellent phone. this k8 note is crap; i will have to throw it away. it is completely unpredictable with signal reception; strong 3g signal with no data; strong 4g signal and then another minute zero signal; strong signal but bad call quality; i can go on & on; it is a very inconvenient user experience. so k-series legacy has been done with motorola\\'s legacy of oblivion. a good device in this budget with these specifications can look for other options in this price range lenovo k8 note good phone its good phone in this price range . good product great paisa wasool sound audio is goodcamera quality is very poordisplay screen not so good super not stable phone... often misbehave while in calling mode... further battery drain toooo fast... thus sold my mobile in half price after using for a month... nice one the design is bad and its too heavy and camera performance is too dull. the fingerprint sensor works well. battery drainage problem is there. it needs a lot of improvement. worst phone ever jio 4g volte not working . fingerprint is limited to unlock only.battery is okspeed is oknot worthy for rs.14000. its outstanding in the price range.awesome. everything is best, if you ignore the battery. seriously, the battery acts like 3000mah.! good fine nice phone a good budget smartphone. functions well though i face bluetooth connectivity problem. however overall it\\'s worth its price. happy with it. product is good up to the mark very good not outstanding good one amazing phone.better than redmi note 4 and moto g5s plus any day worst product... it\\'s a amazing phone with good performance nice look and great value of money , just need a support from amazon to help me for pic replacement as this device takes lot time of charging and drain so fast , i know it\\'s some fault with mine device or else phone is awsome after 7 months of purchase, i updated the software which was recommended by lenovo. the moment after updating the next version of software, the battery life came to 4 hrs. also mobile is getting very hot. i am completely disappointed. 4g connectivity not working network is up down not connect properly call drop nd disconnect internet plz refund my money automatic call recordings not coming in this mobile. lenovo k8 note is a worst mobile with low sound and camera quality..... dont buy ,these amazon peoples will not support for return.simply they used to mention it can be returned within 10 days but no meaning in that..... great device loved it..... i was purchaes a mobile on amazon.com and choose the emi option but they r not convert my amount in emi.so plz don\\'t purchaes any product on emi.. outstanding. great battery. excellent camera. awesome performance i will never recommend to purchase to lenovo mobile. i am very flustered about lenovo product and services. because i purchased four device of lenovo k8 note and all are failed during one month. one goes battery failed, second phone’s speaker failed, third phone sensor stopped to work, and forth one mic problem. this is first time when i took decision to go out from apple samsung and htc but now seems it was very bad idea to choose other from them. lenovo failing to provide good device as well service too. they don’t keep any hardware device in advance. they always order new for new complain and give time line upto 3 days but they won’t give you in three days. it will take almost one and half week to resolve issue. they don’t have good product and good service. not for music lovers product is good doubtful with original product as on invoice it’s not updated with imei number it\\'s nice but received a faulty piece. front camera waste display good sound very bad battery problum excellentbattery back up amazing camera network problem awesome nice phone and i am really happy. super cool features. turbo charger not working properly how to sattings changes???? bs think he....camera not good as expected... nice one product as described. battery drains fast....after 15 min use mobile wormly heatup...and then battery drain fast....wrost experience with lenovo k8…and i try to return product...but amazon customer care not respond me good phone performance of the phone is absolutely good. when it comes to battery backup with heavy usage you will get only half a day of battery backup. everything is good in this phone except heating problem head phone was not in the packet. the phone is good but secondary camera is not as i expected , results of rest things is good ok awesome better than expected sir phone charger problem aa rahi hai kya karain bad phone battery life is very poor quality and camera clarity is very good awesome phone thanks pathetic battery, bad camera, problem in bluetooth, heating issue.very poor product... the charging is not fast and has a lot of heating problem. the new product will work good for few days, but after rough usage it takes 4-5 hrs for full charging. everything in this particular android is working great, i am using it from last 4-5 months, the only issue that i am having is with the so called scratch resistant or you can say scratch proof gorilla glass. it\\'s getting scratches even when put in the pocket of a loose formal trousers as well. i must say there is 0 rating for the lenovo k8 note\\'s screen. never ever buy a lenovo phone in your life... these phones are good just for few months.. after that they start showing their true colors... games lag a lot(even games like subway surfer) please go for a redmi if are looking for a phone to play games (meditek sucks) thank you for this amazing phone functions is very good best phone ever faltuheating problemcamera not good screen is very curved from the sides so tempered is not fitted on the screen good product best hangs up everytime very very execellent product from lenovo. and very good service by amazon. very very very poor battery life. even battery charger stops working within 4 months worth buying glass is not good. so many scraches with in a week.. i did not like it. xiaomi is better in glass quality. average phone i love it good product.. very good phone. atmos is wonderful battery draining very fast within one day the product is good and works fine. the dual camera is not good , but you can take good pictures with normal mode.finger print sensor is fast,the sound is very loud and clear,screen clarity is not very good.sometimes there are problems connecting to mobile networks. very good good goood taking atleast 6 hours to charge camera quality taggicharu nice to use light weight very fast working camera is good anyone want to buy it means buy it very nice product very good excellent features for the rate of mobile. i enjoy it in this price range its really killer but some things like front camera and ui were better even in the k4 note ...pros-* fast processor* turbo charging* lots of ram i.e. 4gb* good sound quality*big battery* metal unibodycons-* no super battery saver mode* bad ui* front camera quality is not as expected looks stunning.. performance is good.. killer than killer phone1) battery backup is up to 7 hour full hard work ,but when no work bttery never drain any percent2) selfie camera is killer but only rear camera is bit average but good i believe lenovo give good update next time3) display and turbo charger are good4) smooth performance of deca core it is a very good phone with a very affordable price everything for this phone i like it not so good a little on the heavier side.. operations superb.. camera is not as good as that of k3 note. no seperate gallery folder for separating photos based on whats-app & clicked ones no the phone is not so good.i am facing problem while listening to calls great phone. this camera showing dust insidenow what to do ? best one his camera performance i like levono poor battery performance bakwaas thanks awesome performace.loved sooo muh this a good phone , camera quality is too good, but the battery back up is not so high when it is online. so so...not awesome neither wow nice good one. battery life is just one day only. lenovo, please include \\'lock screen\\' facility in the start menu. very worst very worst experience. i bought k8 note, with very low battery life. so i returned the product for replacement a week before and i didnt get any update on my replacement till nowvery poor service it is a very good phone good phone but some heating issue. good 🔋 excellent performance it\\'s been a month using the model. quite satisfied with the battery life. the model does hang sometimes, but works great best phone poduct is wrost very bad product hearing issue and battery issue never by lenovo k8 note very good lenovo k8 note set excellent performance. mobile is not good never purchase it horrible battery backup dies in a half day network catching very poor nop my 1st lenovo mobile let me down with the worst performance. after a long while, i bought this lenovo k8 note which is also let me down again.1) deca core processor, but still lags, not fast enough.2) getting heated up like iron box while charging. i think one can iron their clothes with this mobile.3) lenovo still a plenty of work to do to make their mobile phones work better. even, their chinese counter parts - honor & xiaomi are doing great from their failures/set backs. lenovo yet to learn that. this mobile has got very good spec., but it\\'s software is not optimised for better performance. as usual, lenovo lost its basics.4) 4000mah battery, but it doesn\\'t last for a day after the update (not oreo update)there are many issues with this lenovo mobile. so, as others said, don\\'t buy it by seeing the spec. if you do so, you\\'ll be one among us to worry about your decision about buying this mobile. 👎😕🙁😏😓 after 15days of using this phone, below are my observationsprosfast chargingspeakerconsvery bad

application goes on background still they are quite. auto rotating option also disappoint some times. so please be care about it. a very average product. it is almost since more than 6 months i am

brand. i am using this since a week the performance is ok, camera quality, sound, screen, and the features are quite good. the drawback of the phone is it\\'s getting warm when i put it for charging even when i connect it for internet. it\\'s a just a week old product and i just started using it regular since few days. that\\'s something discouraging to suggest others to buy this nice product lenovo k8 note product is ok but heating problem decent phone, camera needs some improvement best mobile buying on my life the phone is not worth the price. besides lenovo is very slow u. providing upgrades. it will provide oreo update byjuly next year. rest all smartphones will be upgraded by the end of this year. shame on lenovo for calling itself even a brand. even mi is much better than lenovo. notifications are not shown on missed calls , unread messages and emails..camera is not so good as.. just for d name sake ..some common features are missing in settings.. notification bar does not hav option for silent mode..there is nothing like turbo or fast charging..main menu cannot b re arranged..in short not upto the mark. nice phone. network issues when using jio sim perfect mobile

contact n in sms directly, multiple no. same contact name, working speed is very slow like 2g phone totally dissatisfied with the battery performance and heating issue. lenovo claims it as turbo charging, but it takes around 4-5 hours for charging 100 %.more over battery drains fast - even if the internet is switched off. if you are planning to buy this mobile, do not forgot to buy a pair of gloves. if not, you may end up burning your hands. awesome mobile & special thanx 2 amazon there is fault in every lenovo k8note. notification light blinks only for unread messages and not for missd calls or emails or any other.lenovo customer care told that by new update release may bring some change in it.so think and buy. the camera of this phone not working properly. excellent performance phone getting hanged. signal issue when i use sim card which works fine in all other phones. lenovo service centre in chennai is pethatic. specially anna salai hcl touch centre no response when u call them on phone numbers.don\\'t buy lenovo brand. amazon we have good faith non i don\\'t all bad brand. why to buy a 4gb ram phone when the high quality games do not run to the utmost. 4000mah battery to die everytime you play games and when your internet is on. it gets warmer. the camera quality is good. but i will not recommend this phone to anyone. 100 rs not refunded and product is very bad becuse my jio sim supported on this phone a smartphone with a lot of problems... good phonebattery normalcamera ok nice and super awosame mobile i love it no issues about the phone i use more then 3 months perfect samrt phone in this budget 😎😍 don\\'t buy this phone bakwaas third class photo quality is so good. awesome speaker. good buy no dislike issues camera clearity is not too good... super camera result was not so good good one for normal user , not ideal for heavy uses & professionals ! camera quality is bad handset hot battery quality low superb product. few of the feature are awesome. duel camera, front 13mp camera, back and front flash, dedicated music button, dedicated memory card slot, free transparent case and split window for multitasking. these are some feature i like the product in my budget. it\\'s very nice phone no problem it\\'s the best phone at low price with stunning graphics and loads of features ......camera quality and battery life is also excellent ......dual led flash makes it even better...... bluetooth problem breaks every time hi friends amazon is doing fraud it took more than an hour for 7% of charging in lenovo k8 note. ..dont buy it either mob is bad or they are giving substandard product n accessory. a poor phone! not for hard and continuous use. dissatisfied with the product the phone which i purchased had defective or non functioning cast service. due to which i have returned the phone. except that problem the phone was good... considering the budget. awesome phone...lite weight without panelbattery life is super and it takes 90 mins for fulfill charge upto 100% bt that charge is long lasting...less heat issue... definitely worth😍 not much good, i\\'m using about 1 year. performance is ok, but facing so many problems, if we use camera frequently it will stop working. if phone restarted it wil work. network issue is the major one. every time it says out of coverage area, we can see the coverage about 30 %. but cant access the internet and couldn\\'t make a call. it will drop automatically, i changed sim. both sim having same problem. so confirmed phone problem. they says this is stock android and we got android update first. we all know new phones are available in market with android oreo os. our stock android lenovo phone still works with noughgat, no update providing, depth mode is fully waste. the photo looks like we edited in 3rd party application. no originality when we take depth enabled picture. they says an option that we can clear the background color as black and white. its lie. it has no option for changing background color. i am using it for the last two weeks. don\\'t buy this one.. mobile keeps restarting itself again and again.. bluetooth done not work properly with bluetooth speaker. music breaks when you play thru youtube or google or any music apps. poor experience !! i hv to switch off my phone in order to charge it ...bcoz when i charge it in a normal way (in switch on mode) battery hardly charges 10% in 1hour ...battery also drains quickly ....can somebdy help me out wid dis ? worth it . amazing mobile worst i have ever seenor useda phone with thia type of chip set is hanging in 100 mb gamesworst performance overall good phone, with good display and good performance. price is perfect.- it has 10 cores which runs fine.- sound is very good.- speed is okay, looks value for money.- camera quality is not too great and also images with dual camera depth looks somewhat like software depth rather than hardware depth from dual cameras. overall picture quality is okay.- earphone should have been part of set not upto the mark no battery backup mobile has network issues. can\\'t receive calls after 5 mins of locking the phone.lenovo hasn\\'t rectified the issue even after many people has reported this issue. not at all recommended. after updating to android 8.0.0 it is even worse. it can\\'t with stand for 5 hrs also. dissatisfied nice nice mobile but camera not so gud fantastic product. timely delivery. value for money :) satisfied in all respect except one, which is, incoming call cannot be received direct like other mobiles. instead, i have to follow a no. of steps to receive a call irrespective of screen locked or not ----- which is much embarrassing. good good mobile.. it meets the requirements... extremly happy with product and amazone service. value of money product. awsm dual camera n feature of this phone is also good .i luv this phone not very good heating problem is there otherwise super phone jhakas phone paisa vasul product.value for money. how ever in this price this mobile contains every thing. stock android experience is awesome.i am confuse about mali processor. why lenovo go downward. but 2 extra high speed processor works excellent. good work by lenovo.my experience about k8 note is i installed high graphic games like asphalt 8. phone runnung smooth even in chrom there is 8 tab were open same time. so many app running background but k8 note running smooth even not heated single time.my opinion is awesome phone grab it. touch is also smooth. u can feel touch.camera quality is poor. if u r going for photos then go for other option. but in this price its paisa vasul. value for money product very good mobile in this price and battery life is ok but my share it aaps not working properly pls fix it next update. very good mobile but game khelte huye hot ho jata h valued for price paid.over all nice performence superb really good good phone i liked very much... system default gallery and file manager ui is not good it just slipped my mind, finally realised the bax didn\\'t had the handsfree headset. ghhh heating problem and some features are not working like live wallpaper and photo gallery is also missing camera poor quality worst product hanging issue and ui is not good k4 note was better than this and battery draining on ideal time is very high ,music player not working properly, worthless for what i have spent thanks for amazon and darshita electronics working good my phone awesome smartphone. i totally loved it .... worth it\\'s price....must buy k8 is fantastic phone. outstanding camera and battery life is very long. i enjoy using the phone. back camera..!! :d cell phone is awesome some camera drawback but motherboard is producing some kind of problem like hanging and battery draining and timing problem the clock is not showing the proper timing but ultimately phone is awesome i would definitely read it 5 star but due to this problem i am writing it 3 star and i know the problem is the processor that is mediatek which drinks a lot of battery and i\\'m not a stable processor device is getting over heated and battery is draining fast 1)i must say if you are a k4 user then k8 music will just disappoint you.2) the camera performance will break your heart really .3) battery backup is not good as 4000mah.if you buy this phone for music, battery and camera please don\\'t buy this phone nothing to say about this product buy it network problem is a big issue, amazon even don\\'t accept it and pdoduct is not returnable warest mobile don\\'t taken very very bad charging & battery packup ossam best phone really, it has so many features, long battery, fingerprint sensor, voice recognition, unlocking through eyes and face, loud speakers, microsoft office package,great 📷 , multasking screen, vr mode.. 😍😍😍😍 nice mobile worst product..poor camera clarity.. heating issue i bought this mobile on 28th aug 17, for month it runs normal but then started problem. problem as heating on normal use, very slow charging, rear camera blurr...i feel amazon should take responsibility of the products they promoting/selling. so the no customer should face or meet with defective items. it is a must buy phone. heavy games supported well and there were no lag in performance. camera and processor deserve 5 stars. very good mobile with amazing features battery not good for 4g it\\'s amazing phone. sometimes contact list will not show and sometimes it doesn\\'t call to the orange wht we select nice handset. very good battery backup and good picture quality. camera not so perfect..expectations were high..otherwise super value for money useless product appears as in photo and works as stated. it seems all latest mobiles arrive without offline music player and this mobile also doesn\\'t have one. it is not a deal breaker since many apps available at play store. overall nice experience and thank you seller and amazon nice it\\'s really an awesome phone... camera is excellent.. battery backup is really good...just one problem for me is after capture a photo when i swipe to see it the error shows \"activity not found\"...hope will get solution for this by lenovo... after all must buy phone... bakwas phone best phone ever camera quality is awesome but depth mode is goid not excellent. overall performance + battery life is awesome gives me 2 days backup on normal usage and 1 day backup on heavy usage and i never charged it more then 2 hrs. excellent good good one very bad product.... specifications are not up to the mark very slow phone. phone is good but picture quality is not good in depth mode don\\'t buy this product otherwise you will get so much tension about your phone.its having so much problem in this like hanging, sometimes camera not working,poor image quality,less battery backup etc. product so good but amazon service are bad. waste of time and money. k5 note works better than this. worst phone by lenovo. hardware problems were existing and had to return. convincing amazon about the problem was a nightmare. it to be average phone lenovo k8 note is very good phone battery work is very good 4 gb ram 64 gb rom and extra music button front camera is very good bad battery backup...can\\'t exchange phone now...after using for some days i conclude this phone has a bad battery backup + average performance...4000mah battery lasts for 5 or 5hrs 30mins screen time at max..while using it on less than 25% brightness ... waste product dont buy this mobile,and dolby is not working, and so many problems occuring , don\\'t waste your money performance is not upto the marks, it hangs. excellent mobile phone..i luv this product very very very bad product from lenovo. lot 9f bugs. major bug is sim signal strenth is very low with all the sim\\'s. unable to receive all the calls. unable to call someone on time. need to call multiple times. voice is breaking. call get disconnected frequently. voice quality is also bad. pakka cheating company. very bad turbo charger it\\'s just one month & mobile is getting charged very slowly worse than normal charger. otherwise mobile is okay. lenovo say me phone screen is un breakable but its ot true its fraud the sceen break with simple force nice phone with this priceworking very good this is the best phone for gaming and traveling very very bad. taking 5 hours in charging and got discharged with in 12 hours only. even the processing is also very slow. waste of money i got this mobile in offer, but battery drain very quickly so plz don\\'t buy this product from morning 9 to evening 5 it comes to 10 percent, before i asus it have 2 days of battery, if i speak to lenovo and amazon they told reset ur device, there is no battery saving app in this model if we compare with redmi mi-note 4 the battery backup & processing speed is very poor heating problem is too much. worst phone, takes 2days to charge full battery and heats up like iron box. could not replace the phone bcoz amazon tech team says the phone is normal and direct me to lenovo service which is a waste of my time on a brand new phone. and now i\\'m stuck with this heavy brick of electronic crap. not worth even a star, very disappointed with unlimited problems. not at all happy with camera.front camera is 13 mp but very bad quality video and pictures.please don\\'t buy those who are looking for good picture. great phone, except for one irritant, processors heat up when playing high graphics oriented games like war robots and lags to keep up....else, it\\'s a workhorse with great battery phone is slim,good battery backup and camera quality is nice. satisfied with its performance!! please avoid this amazon certified product. got mobile from amazon within 8 days it got crack in glass while keeping in pocket. in original product they have mention as gorilla glass. but it cracked simply it must be fake. am really worried. totally un-satisfied with amazon now.i face similer issue before. in you tube they tested the mobile with heavy tools its working without simple scratch. hear after i never buy anything in amazon. customer support they have well training to handle the customer without worry about customer query simply they make us believe it all user fault. oh god its really painful. good gr8 fone.fingerprint at back is gr8 good mobile nice acha h ...very nice worst experience ever with amazon and lenovo phone.after updating phone battery is not even running for 2 hours.don\\'t go for lenovo phone all update is very pathetic.phone keep hanging for whatsapp. and small apps.amazon given this product after 10 days of booking,very poor deliver.overall it\\'s very bad experience with lenovo phone and amazon service.both are cheaters. worth... reviewing k8 note after 30 days used,there is no heating issue but feel little bit warm.smooth interfacing & performance.turbo charging good.charge gets drain while downloading movies in torrent using mobile data ( jio4g ).wifi connectivity good. excellent phone...superb camera and speed of processor is awesome...terrific design ...slim n stylish...smooth display and good battery backup..value for

poor.dual camera is only for name. in depth pic blurs the object and background.bluetooth connectivity is worst. always breaking when connected to car bluetooth.network signal always shows only 1 bar. download speed is like 2g. it takes hell lot of time to download a simple app in play store.now amazon is not refunding it. feels like cheated after paying so much of money. totally unsatisfied. pls don\\'t buy it ok ok product not good not badback camera is worked it should include a good headphone because they are providing dolby functionality. awesome phone at this price very bad a black in the name of lenovo product. battery draining out rapidly and phone heating up abnormally like an iron. overall horrible. very very very poor.....camera some times not open it&flashlight....very very wost product my money is waste charing complete hang....not using compatable so sad don\\'t bye a lenovo product because company service support not available in tamil nadu. any problems in your lenovo phone. then ready to expenses minimum 1000 rupees.also find the service centre location in your lenovo phone (lenovo help ) . map showing no any service centre in india. battery discharging very quickly. good but no cast screen everything ok except battery draining too fast. very poor quality 3rd grade product . pathetic service awesome phone multi split screen w/o soliciting is disturbing. sometimes internet is not available. nice product all ok in this price..but need work in camera.. front camera is not good,call recording not abailable only money waste...... nice handset nice phone but no boked camera wark features not meet as per my expectation. good performance....best price..super model bahot hi bakwas phone hai. mere bhai ke pas tha. abhi ek update ane ke bad itna garm ho jata tha ki kan jal jaye. lenovo is failing in terms of software. also plz dont buy a phone with mediatek processor. they heatup like iron. very nice mobile by lenovo nice phn is handi nd otherwise is very gd but ist heating little bit use back cover to help for use... the phone start responding to random touches without even touching it.and it started happening within 5 minutes of starting to use.the return/replace requests on app/site are of no use.the chat with customer care wasted much time only to be told that i need to call.when called, it again wasted time and then i was connected to phone department.they listened to problem and and put me on hold for 15 minutes.they must be thinking i will disconnecting but i didn\\'t.anyways after the call resumed, i was told that there is no issue with the phone. they have verified it with emei no. now this is insane.so the next step would be to search for a service centre and get a certificate from them that the phone is defective and then only it can be returned/replaced. all this within 10 days.so much for the famed amazon prime service.its better to visit hot-spot and buy a phone from there. their service is just amazing. best value for money! only concern is camera clarity it\\'s not as expected as good.. i hope in 12 - 14 k range this is one of the best mobiles. better than mi4 doesn\\'t have call recording. cast screen not working. awesome mobile not suggested nor recommended very poor camera. bluetooth is not working properly very good fastest process are this phone. worst mobile don\\'t buy this mobile

heating issue while gaming on my device. both front and rear cameras are good but the depth mode camera is ok. also i am little confused about lte or volte ad i am not using jio. but worth buying as a budget phone battery performance is not too good as expected also turbo charginh....camera is little good in depth mode but selfie camera is much better then vivo v7...overall performance is good..music quality is best. fingerprint work too fast that make u easy to unlock device in seconds...but there no notification option for battery percentage , data speed etc no wifi connection catch in my dell vostro 1510 i will try all type but anyone can\\'t help me heating issue is noticed network issues with the phone only 2 or 3 bars of network for any sim card, internet speed is very slow due to network issue. rear camera is bad. wifi hotspot not connect in laptop. sound is good. product is ok receive awesome product.. hello,the phone starts resetting itself randomly. this issue starts after after 3 days of use, especially when you use it for longer time like watching a you tube video for an hour or two. the issue starts to repeat after 1 or 2 days, then i tried few option mentioned in lenovo help app which is pre-installed(i am feeling like a stupid for having done this) , after that for 4 or 5 days it didn\\'t show this issue. now it back with a bang and almost resets itself every night. use the phone in night, then lock it and keep aside and when you take the phone again in the morning, boom, it is dead already. and when you manually power-on there is enough juice left in the battery. not sure what to do with this kind of issue, the phone is absolutely useless.when i approached amazon for return, they are quoting policy and suggest me that i should run pillar to post to get problem rectified (not sure even it is rectifiable issue), the below amazon\\'s tagline tag-line sounds funny\" earth\\'s most customer-centric company.\", i am not really sure whether they understood what they really mean, i am already started feeling bitter for my purchase decision in amazon and now i realized that buying lenovo brand is same as throwing your money into garbage. it\\'s amazing...superb sound, awesome camera... its a complete package... awesome product nice product turbo charging stopped working with the in - box charger 10days after buying..first gave 4 stars to this,but now i would have given 0 star if it existed..i wouldn\\'t have bought the phone if it wasn\\'t for turbo charger..not only this,there are still many cons..like cast option doesn\\'t work ..but this is a major problem..and the service is worst..the charger didn\\'t work for the second time and the service centre wierdos lied that the warranty period for the charger is over and asked to pay rs 1500/- for the new one..and know what..? the charger still has 6 months warranty left..!! selling phones by making false statements..lenovo sucks.. i bought this phone with lot of hopes going by the specs described. however, it was a huge disappointment..big mistake!. the phone is absolutely rubbish..blue tooth was not working, volume and sound output was very poor (considering that lenovo claims those are dolby stereo), camera was not up-to the mark, display was not abysmal, colour display was nothing to write home about..all in all it is one helluva disaster of a phone...in summary please dont buy..its not worth the money..i wouldnt pay even 5000k for this! the phone is overall gud but has no battery backup and the phone is heating.better on camera in normal mode.has great aminities but it has to fix many problems!!! phone is heating like hell even on little use. not recommended at all. owsm i got this phone on time. but i didn\\'t like the phone. so it depends upon individual to buy. so think & buy phone is good but there is some issues like over heating, depth effect is not working properly . bekar hai mat lo koi mobile is good but i have issue with battery..it takes too much time for getting full charge upto 100% and heating issue.. after update to 8.0, it\\'s drain battery like anything.... battery hardly run for 4 hr... very poor battery life and no quick chargedual camera is just for sake of name worst camera mobile is awesome but there need to be improvement in delivery.overall impressed by the mobile. good battery back up will come 5 hourhs of normal usage camera not so clearphone mic not working ... not good quality, camera also not good ,headphone not avilable, it\\'s very good hello everyone.i bought two of these for me and my friend.

wifi/bluetooth won\\'t turn on after few days .2. battery gets drained within 3 hours of use.3. they said turbo charging, but it take 2-3 hrs to charge . good evren k3 note was much better, problems in this mobile are many. camera is not of good quality. it hangs a lot, call list and details r missing, even display of network speed is missing. multiple app usimg is not there, battery doesnt lasts

speed... it\\' heat\\'s very lightly... automatically cools down.. better to give the option to cool down not to make heat repeatedly features are perfect but its interior view is not so good at this price range.... and seeing facilities ... doing a decent work. very nice phone in this price range.phone looking good & battery back up is very good.but it\\'s not lenovo phone it\\'s motorola phone. all phone settings & features are motorola.no call recording is calling screen.no gallery in the menu.charging jack too tight.back button is given left side.camera quality is not good. not capture clear image... my lenovo k4 note is clicks decent picture.overall rating would be 3 out of 10. takes 21, days to reach kerala ha ha... good mobile phone.and good quality superb....everything is very nice ....working too good... great hardware but poorly optimized android and camerathough good value for money nyc mobile.. good productexcellent camera, performance and battery life worst phone... heating issue... network issue... don\\'t buy it... turbo charger???? wtf!!! it takes more than 3hrs to charge fully!!! and battery??? it doesn\\'t performs as 4000 mah battery!!! camera is well!some app doesn\\'t support!!!!!suggest u not to buy!!!! the screen breaks so easily this mobile will not withstand for the 4g speed, and support from amazon will also by unhelpful.i suggest please do not buy this mobile its not good. even after the technical confirmation on heating and network issue they will not refund anything. waste of money one more best smartphone by lenovo. i got my package in same condition as it mentioned by amazon. battery life is great and of course memory is more than enough with 64 gb internal memory. awesome mobile in this price.little bit hitting issue. battery problem average performance speaker not working,hence i want to replace the item waste of money and time.. . not working properly with android 8.0 update. phone is discharging in minutes and taking more than 7hrs hours to 100% charging. while using the mobile its heating like a iron box numer 1 phone in this price range.... when will k8 get camera update for better boke effect?? its not performing well.. mobile is ded not warking not as expected.heating too muchbattery drain vastlycall recorder not supported not bad very worst experience, got used one product with missing manual. looks like product was second buy. sound is very low with any earphone and head phone. the phone is ok. nothing really extra-ordinary about it. in fact, the battery life is not as good as they claim. mine does not last a day..despite the fact that i am not watching any videos or playing video games. i am facing problem of dual sim network in this phone. usually the sim 1 works fine but sim 2 doesn\\'tget the network. i interchanged the sim position but the problem countiued. both sim work perfectly fine in other mobiles..i got the mobile replaced but same problem with other handset.another thing i noticed is that despite of killer specifications phone is lagging a little bit in simple tasks like opening photos etc..it takes time to focus on displayed photos in gallery.i didn\\'t even downloaded any games. its really surprising... i was initiallyvery excited about this mobile but i found it over rated now..moreover, i guess with the passage of time unfortunately the quality of goods at amazon is deteriorating day by day. i have been a loyal customer of amazon from so many years but now i think i should look for other options....really disappointed this time... it\\'s literally cheating the people with wrong information on long lasting battery & turbo charging feature as both features are not as per the specifications. its a good phone but don\\'t know how to handal dual rear cam. ........ camera worsted lenovo china phone duplicate phone earphones no camera 3 mega bad worst experience with amazon first time given worst mobile fraction of seconds battery drained even next time also phone hanging a lot nice model i am like but heat problem nice phone love it👍 call this a battery drainage ...camera although good but dual camera bas ek bakwaas hai....its good in performance but battery drainage isuue is there ..it supports turbocharger ...no volte feature...anyways i bought it in sale so goid value for money i paid.no lag in playing big games.but camera upsets. v v good damage pice it\\'s very useful for me.. it\\'s a amazing phone. thanks to amazon. good fone..good camera..but charging takes a lot of time..nd need some software updates ...my old k3note is better and faster than this k8 note writing this review after using this mobile for one week.fast delivery by amazon and packaging is good.phone is some what heavy, but still manageable. when i switched on internet it asked for some system updates, before those updates i didn\\'t face much issue with the mobile, but after that update if u charged ur mobile once it reached 100% automatically phone will be switched off. so we can\\'t charge it in the night and have to unplug it before it\\'s reaching 100%.battery backup is ok. will last for one day if you didn\\'t play much games. you can\\'t cover the screen entirely by using tempered glass, because of edge design. charging is taking much time eventhough it\\'s saying it has quick charge option. earphone is missing in the box. camera clarity is average. they have opted so many moto technologies, but still needs to improve a lot.android 8.0 update will be received on july as per lenovo. i believe with in that they will launch the next version. lenovo k8 note not working properly.1) not getting connected to pc.2) no notifications on apps.3) contacts (some) disappears. good product please provide me the bill of the product. great experience very good phone at this budget. till now configuration is best in the market in this price. after completing 2 month. this is the best ever phone i have. best processor nice mobile worth it\\'s screen got cracked though it dropped from a two feet distance and they boast of gorilla glass.secondly there is no service station for lenovo in city like jalandhar. there is only one charger int the box. please change the description. its good this is worst product by lenovoi have purchased so many lenovo phones but this is the one where i have faced critical issue.network issue at some places phone seems not reachable super phone good really good product good smartphone! feels good heating problem camera and battery backup is not up to the mark phone is value for money. only one problem, it can\\'t cast mobile screen to tv. camera quality is very poor and very slow phone very good product poor one of the best phone in this price range. front camera awesome. dual back camera works fine. low light performance is good. only problem is back camera takes 2-3 seconds to focus.dual camera effects are good. battery backup is great. 10 core processor works really well. disply is bright and color output is crispy. having full networks then too,getting missed call alerts,volte not fully supported support needed to resolve this one worse product i ever have.... amazon\\' s fake promises with returning policies. even u can\\'t return it after one day of delivery.......heating issues.battery drains automatically, does not matter if u r using or not.dual rear camera is not up to the mark. good product i strongly recommended with this price rangegood camera rare & front flashwith long last battery back upno heating issuelatest android n7 excellent in price range.problem faced in coverage . worth of money...good phone...nice features...user friendly awesome phone good battery back up fully satisfied too much heat ... battery backup not good lenovo k8 note battery quality is worst. it has stopped charging in just 3 months. good it takes 10 clicks to unlock the phone. calls don\\'t get picked up. calls don\\'t get disconnected. horrible experience. don\\'t but this phone. amazon isn\\'t helpful as they used to be :( not bad.but price of this phone should be low. waste mobile this phone claims that it has gorilla glass. i bought this phone about 45 days ago(lenovo k8 note). my phone has tampered glass on it. as my phone fall once from my bed and the whole screen got cracked.(there was not a single scratch on my tampered glass) one of the worst phones i have ever come across in my life..horrible in all aspects..battery gets drained in half a day..phone hangs often..i feel cheated don\\'t not bill reserved not so good iam return mobile the note series always been the champion for the lenovo. so as this product, amazing product at this prise point, some cool new stuff, a bit different experience compared to past note series obviously its a killer note...#top speed#good looks#great overall performance... amazing buy. great phone and great features. very good deal for the price. not awesome...consgallery missingthemes missingbattery% not showing - showing while chargingmusic player missingspeed booster, antivirus missingcamera not as expectedin other hand i\\'m having honor 8x pro which i got for 28000 from amazon (double of lenovo k8) but far far better than this phone and loaded with features.unable to contact lenovo help center...always giving sign-in issues. fed up to contact them very bad product battery pickup lo there is no such thing as turbo charging in this phone as promised by lenovo ,it took almost 4hours to charge fully. there is heating issue while charging. not at all happy with the camera, did dozen times video calling with friends but every time screen was black there was no light. and video was not full hd when i was watching in full screen mode in youtube, it felt more like am watching in low defination handset. i loved the looks though, screen is smooth and performance is good. hate to return this phone because of the looks but can\\'t compromise with the camera and heating issues. nice lid or glass ni aaya awesome mobile with best camera quality .can\\'t go underrated good in every thing but camera is not as per expectation. phone got heated suddenly and battery goes down so quickly.. i couldn\\'t record my call\\'sear phones are not working properly camera quality is superb and battery also long lasting overall phone is good, but camera quality is worst.8 megapixel camera is just better than lenovo ki note nice and excellent mobile good performance phone is fine. good in looks. good features. best that anyone can have in this budget.battery is really disappointing. it says 4000 mah. but drains out very soon.doesnt last for even a day. we got a replacement from amazon for this problem. the other piece too has sam quality battery. in lenovo k8 gallery app is missing . very good product good nice mobile lenovo product apps nothing is there only moto apps r theresend quick os updateno handset updated review:i had used redmi 4a before & never had any network issue with vodafone. but with this phone., i;m constantly switching from 3g to $g to 3g depending on the area.battery is draining fast unless you charge it to full for over 3 hrs.can someone recommend where to buy the orginal fast charger for this? mine got damaged in the rain.so i have only been using it for less than 24hrs, but here\\'s what all i discovered:-cons1. heating issue exists. while i spent time trying to figure out this depth mode, my cam was on for around 15 -20 min with wifi running in the background. the phone started getting warmer in my hand to the point that you could just almost be uncomfortable.2. slippery back cover-although the phone comes with a transparent hard back cover, it\\'s still a bit slippery. the original cover is like a magnet for patches & sweaty hands do no good to it.3. battery-when i unboxed the phone(around 6pm) it had some 46% charge already which however lasted only until 12am, 6hours with no gaming or media usage. surprisingly when the battery alarm went off at 15%, it lasted for just 10 min before shutting down. if 15% charge with low battery mode activated gives me just 10 min, thats really pathetic i\\'d say. with my redmi 4a, i used to survive at least an hour with 15% charge. very disappointed.4. network issues. i used vodafone 4g. while mobile data lacked any disruptions in connection, what i found is low voice quality. even in open spaces, there was loss of voice & the bars for network weren\\'t full.pros-1. the dolby atomos speakers -4/5 would need to figure out how to control the bass etc. speakers are quite loud though, haven\\'t yet checked with the ringer volume when phone is in pocket.2. front cam-again excellent. i especially love the flash, which does\\'t give you an ashen look, but colour stays vibrant.3. depth mode- the bokeh mode does take about 10-15 min of practice to figure out. the after effects like removing background & selective monochrome are great.4. no lags yet. i\\'m yet to install any games, but after opening around 5-6 social media apps , te phone didn\\'t show any lags.5. display with the adaptive brightness on is a treat. no more squinting in the sun to make out whats on the screen. also when i played videos, the clarity was brilliant. can\\'t wait to try the vr mode.6. split screen feature is quite convenient, i used with whatsapp & chrome.will update more after a few days of use, especially about the battery which is the main reason i bought this phone very good i have purchased this product before 2 weeks.🔈speaker performance is 0 out of 5 as compared to k4 noteit is quiet disapoainted me that it doesn\\'t support dolby atmos .but company is saying it is dolby atmos.camera is out of focus.totaly worst as compared to other dual cam phones.battery back up is 1 day.only plus is heavy speed in browsing and.hd pictures .screen quality is average.1 out of 5😢😢😢do not buy this model.better u go for k4 or k3 i am so much loving this phone, its amazing i think its best phone. everything is best!! camera quality is amazing.. the moment i installed oreo 8.0 on ,02may it started heating up @ now battery is giving up in 4-5 hrs... i have purchased it on 09 oct2017 battery heating issue , battery drains , its taking 14 to 15 hrs to charge full phone and within 2 hrs battery is 0% ,most off time does not even charge , service center people are also not responding they also don\\'t know what to do they r saying it\\'s because of system update .. i am using lenovo 1st tym hope this issue will get resolved otherwise i will never recommend this brand to anyone,..very upset good but one only speaker workingbut now all other phones better it. i liked the product and.it is delivered on time.. this product not good,why means over heting.i want another company phone? dont buy this product i don\\'t know why some people have given 5 or 4 star rating to this crap. this phone has serious issues regarding everything. the dual camera setup is something like \\'jugaad\\' of dslr quality photography. i didn\\'t find any serious performance issues as it is mediatek,not snapdragon. i expect nothing great from mediatek. the biggest drawback is the screen quality. i was watching a video on youtube, suddenly i thought i should increase the resolution to check the quality of screen. dude,it was already playing on 1080p! screen just doesn\\'t feels like full hd i.e. 1080p not even close to 720p. dolby audio is nothing but just a fake software. vr works like charm. fingerprint is good, responsive. didn\\'t find issues with call quality or wifi reception. build quality is strictly average due to just fine metallic body. phone will get heated up if you play games or watch video. backlit navigation bar is not there,that means during night,you will probably end us guessing the navs. front camera is again ok,selfie flash just another light feature on image. turbo charging is again not so impressive. earphone jack is not of standard size or configuration as ejecting or inserting is little hard. overall average phone,i am waiting for the customer care call to return this phone. hugely disappointed! it\\'s good n easy to use good mobile....smooth running.... good one. plzzz reduce heating issue.... battery draining issue... battery is not upto like it defined....poor camera issue..n add 4k recording...n minor features like lock for different apps.. front style...dual app... gestures... screenshot shortcut..screen off shortcut.. select memory card for default storage..wallpaper download...ram management... plzzzzzz do all this....its all necessary....plzzz lenovo do all this.... not satisfied, sound system is very week and contacts saving problem issue was same as k4 in sound k4 was best, not worthy please go to other phone\\'s... mobile is getting very hot for all times..and hang while working... i have buy this product 2 weeks back and till now no issue.but camera quality is not that much good.overall phone is good.but redmi note 4 is also better choice. sb kuch sahi h pr heating bahut krta h phone or battery bahut bekar chalti h 3-4 ghante use

every features that a smartphone required.deca core processor long lasting battery and 64gb internal memory with 4gb ram is just awesome.i would certainly recommend this phone for users having usage and game lovers i have connect the phone via sony blue tooth ,video getting hang while watching video in youtube or any other app .i don\\'t understand the prob , while connecting the same bluetooth to other phone it work properlythe prob is only with video ..audio and voice call work properlypls suggest the solution ... poor signal reception good but heating issue nice phone, pleased to have it, thanks amazon for delivering it my lenovo k8 note left side speaker not working... very poor is lenovo k8note no star . ist time m disappointed from amazon service cameras not as expected, not able to take good pics as compared to latest iphone models. the dual mode is not much as expected, especially outdoors, it needs to be worked on. it\\'s ok for a normal user, but quality is why people buy a camera phone, especially a photography lover like me, i give the camera, including the dual mode, a 6.5/10.powerful performance, no doubt we can enjoy using heavy apps without any problems. 64 gb internal memory is enough for me, 8/10.light weight body, easy to handle. good android software. panels should have been backlit, you have to search them in dark 😞, 7/10. it\\'s nice smartphone. smart features and awesome to uses. the camera quality is nice. mostly battery backup is fantastic. you must purchase from amazon. amazon give very cheap price. got the same phone from flipkart at 8540/- plus they have given me 10% discount on hdfc card.  no option of sms sending for both sim (you have to select one default. no option of \"ask for sim\") led notification light not working no option to stop vibration when other end user pick up the phone !!! battery is drain very fast in mediateck processor. not showing battery percentage in mortification bar.. i dont suggested for it.so many software glitchs.no gallary, no speedeter, only symbols appears in short menu(no name on it how to identify)heating problems also. superb phone at an awesome price bahut hi ghatiya mobile hai . best performance front flash fault he mobile me nice the phone loses the signal even though it shows full strength. i keep receiving missed call notifications. seems like hundreds of people have confirmed this model\\'s signal issues. one amazon exec. promised a reimbursement but the systems were not working for a few days. when i called back after some time they said they can\\'t reimburse, only replace the same model. the model is faulty and i don\\'t want it. don\\'t know what to do. i\\'m willing to buy a more expensive phone from amazon, but they\\'re throwing a policy which isn\\'t mentioned when u buy. sad and frustrated. battery 4000mah but itzn\\'t lasting till 9 pm :( earlier i had micromax unite pro q465 wid a btry of 3900 mah that was lasting till 11 pm. ok mobile phone. doesn\\'t hang and heat up when one uses for long periods. buts its camera is absolutely not up to mark. doesn\\'t takes good pics. its built-in casting app is also not working. bkvas phonenot bay camera no rijalt like very nice mobile lenovo k8 note (venom black, 4gb) very bad tracking system...need to improve... not good battery 🔋 is draining quickly than expected not so good good it\\'s is fantastic good good service and product. no quality not able to cast tv battery backup very very poor, other aspects it is above average. good performance. fast work. nice photos. camera averagebatery drain out more faster than f1 car. in over night it drop down from 76% to 63% . and it most worst make by amazon software services provider app #smartchk which never detects any problems at all. its mean customer cant exchange there defective so called smart phone. phone heating after using camera.led screen really good. 2nd sim is only 3g. it\\'s not 4g. amazon + lenevo makes india #bakra best in the range..u can call it a power and a performance beast..display is elegant ..great bulit and design.. issue with the low light and depth mode camera otherwise offers a good camera in daylight and shows good details in images captured..go for it. camera weak awesome mobile .... nice .. one line review.... donot but this......worst batteryworst cameraworst network battery is draining very fast... mobile is not running more than 8-10 hours. and charging time with turbo charger is more than 2 hours for full charging which is not comply it\\'s specifications. got a faulty product. had some charging issue.mobile was heating up a lot while charging.thanks a ton to amazon for refund.i am giving 5 stars to amazon service not to the product.please dont buy. heating too much and , chraging fastly drying 😪😪 sweet superbb camera and sounds good!!! excellent. love this now i am using for about 3monts, and it still working as it should be though while playing games it easily heat up worst charging, charge draining quickly... good i like most this handset. nice handset the charger is not working properly. it is taking longer than 6 hrs time to charge the battery. the handset gets hot very frequently . very upset with the product .. i will not prefer lenovo any more ... poor support ,,camera hangs every day requiring a restart,everytime you have to use it. issues:1) mobile network keeps fluctuating all the time and too many call drops...2) sms centre number manual update option is missing.. not able to send and receive sms most of the time.3) gets restarted without any reason...will not recommend for purchase... good mobile phone crap great very less features , no touch screenshot no crop no editing ram is running half full in just 1 day so 4 gb is nothing for this device , not find manual book no bill good phone in the price range. stock android always better then customized android. great good product. i buy last year october. my cellphone now coming heat. what will be do. i think need service. kindly advice me. over all is a good phone. good battery backup, no hanging problem, no heating problem. but does miss lots of features, like, anti virus. also, the camera could have been still better. awesome performance,ram managment is good,heating happens when camera works for long time,camera quality is a con.fits in hand amazing product at this price. i really loved it. hi all , i am writing this review after a long time as i realised that people are missing noticing one big disadvantage of this phone.i ordered this phone on the first day of it\\'s sale. i got it in two days. the day i got it i noticed that while you connect your phone to the charging and at the same time you keep operating the phone like watching youtube videos or surfing the facebook or wats app then it stops charging . i mean its battery percentage does not increases or it increases by 1% in 10 mins or so.the second thing i noticed is when you connect the phone through data cable to laptop or cpu then also it does not charges or charges with very slow rate like the one i mentioned above.i then asked for replacement as i thought there might be some defect in my set.however, even the set i got after replacement had the same issue. finally i had to go for the return and refund.i think this is a manufacturing defect which exists in all lenovo k8 note sets.i therefore advise everyone to check this issue in their set and if it\\'s not a major concern for you then all other aspects of the mobile are great.i hope this helps. :) this product isn\\'t appropriate.heating problem camera quality not good faulty product delivered. not charging. shuts down. presently in service centre. please don\\'t buy.check the review section only 35% are positive. i wish i had seen it before. battery problem....heating problem.....aap open problem..in all i gave 0 out of 10 the glass broke off within a month of purchase and asking rs.5500 for original screen replacement in the official lenovo service centre. poor quality of glass . other than that all features are nice . good camera .sound is not coming through another set of speakers worst phone ever i have wasted my money after update it took 8 to 10 hours for 50percent charging shame on lenovo for stupid product the phone is good but. the battery of this phone is too bad ..... totally worst mobile......it has hanging issue and app crashed are normal in this mobile. even this mobile have deca core processor.go to redmi mobile that are cheaper than it and have better hardware option..... so sexy phoch ... very good i received a k8 note with mic problem.there was some lagging effectwhile using depth enable mode .display clarity was not up to the mark. heating problem.. not worthable for 14k. only i loved the stock android ui. i mean...i got a faulty charger which makes a hissing sound when charging and it heats like you have some boiled water on your hands..the weight is okk..the phone heats a lot while playing games so they provided a cover ..but the phone is very good at gaming and my jio works perfect for me.....but overall i\\'d give it a 4/10 rateing.. sound quality is not good and it doesnt have volte support even15 gb is taken internal only nice phone for 14000rs first i would like to tell about amazon service, its really too good, they delivered a product within a day.the phone has aswome configuration in paper, but when use it you will not feel that. when you hold the phone itself you ll feel that you are holding some low cost chinese phone.the problems i have faced i. 2 days1.ok google command didn\\'t work, when i try to enable it said your microphone is not working.2.mobile internet rarely works but if you put in other mobile it works fine same is the case with signal strength as well.3.charging they mentioned fast charger but it takes 1.5 hrs for full charge.4.it heats up in 5min game also. mobile is good, it has two speaker but one is\\'t working... battery backup is very very poor (it is not up to mark) not like 4000 mh charger is not working and mobile is also totally hang phone is heating when charging after all is too good.. good but camera quality is ok nd video not so clear everything is good except camera quality. jio 4g sim not working , phone heating problem. currently phone is submitted to auth lenovo center.6 days still they are working looks big design problemi want to return this product and mind you returning is very difficult. amazing phone not good better mobile made for edm lovers 🙌🙌🙌🙌music with dolby atmos 👌👌👌 overall good phone, but camera not so good compared with redmi note 4.battery lasts long, volte works, a bit poor coverage reception compared to vibe x3 (3g/4g).build quarlity is good. some of the bugs. manish thanks to amazon customer service for delivering before 2 days for my kind requestthank you amazon team for taking my concernproduct was so good.little bjt disappointed with camera and battery but looking for this budget this is so good and comfortable. 10 core killer classic 😍 great camera is bad..heating issue a lot when we switch on to camera ..battery backup is also not that much good..but worth product for this type of specifications..overall it\\'s a good one if u have no battery problem means .. owsm btry life in working in 4g net like worst product no glue very bad..regret for buyingpoor options compared to vibe k5 note...many options that are present in vibek5 are not present. cheaters. how can we expect less features in higher cost version phone??no

wifi are not working. aswome phone very good phone good overall smartphone nice phone. battery back is too bad, also it takes lot of time to charge. i would not recommend this product to anyone not

turbo version. lenovo k8 note, that i purchased it is one of the worst mobile, lots of issues are there with mobile.1 battery heating2 charging problem3 hang i have given poor rating because the camera in my set is defective. on every pic a white light is coming at the top. extremely satisfied with his product from lenovo. had been looking for a phone with this kind of specification and pricepoint for quite a long time. and lenovo note 8 turned out to be just the right fit for me. dual sim, dedicated sd card slot, great battery, stock android. got this at less than 10k in amazon great india sale. would recommend to all those looking for best mobile under 15k. over heating issue while light usage like just in internet connection, and always warm while connected to internet.

really good but camera quality really awosome my lenovo k8 note which i bought from amazon after 10 days got sim slot jammed when i call customer care to return they are saying now it\\'s 11th day and

good mobile heating &charger percentage problem so please replace new one not at all .it was heating like a iron.probably it would be good for winter heats up too quickly while playing any game,heats

in all terms...display...design..software...sound...etc the mobile was a wastage of time and effort for me. it restarts every now and then. sometimes, it keeps on restarting until the battery drains fully. apps don\\'t open properly. apps crash everytime. tried resetting to the factory settings. no use. lenovo, please answer and tell me what to do.karthik rohil7736832940 camera quality is not as good as shown in advertisement.being a high class category and latest mobile of lenevo still system update oreo will take much time to receive according to sources. yeah i have all taken from this... nice camera.. give you 90% satisfaction.. 😎 price dropped after i bought it ... sad .. almost 2000rs loss worst phone ever seen no dash charging and on normal usage it overheats.. lenovo k8 note - battery discharging quick when net is in on condition and phone not used (kept ideal), there is no default call recording option in this model aloneam purchased this lenovo k8 note mobile through online (amazon) on 09.10.2017. following problems are noticed,1.battery discharging quick when net is in on condition but phone not used (kept ideal),2.there is no default call recording option in this model alone whereas other models have this option.actually am planned to purchase this phone brand (lenovo k8) for think of this option & 4000mah battery only. i couldn\\'t see this mobile demo before purchase because this is online purchase model.but now am facing difficulty. expecting a software upgrade with default call recording option (as like other models) and suggestions for battery saving. the phone is a great buy..for the price and the features,it\\'s a steal ! worth every penny. i read reviews about a lot of pros and cons but in the end i\\'d reckon it\\'s how you use the phone to its optimal level. heating it is a worst mobile i have purchasedcontact automatically vanishdoes not support screen mirroringno support for otgno gallery lot of issues with the ui.. pl don\\'t buy the phone !! 4 month old phone and i am getting a resale value of 900 /- on amazon!!!! very very nice moble overall ok i have got a defective phone , can\\'t restart after inserting the sim card for the very first time bettery drain fastly and hang problem hit problem network issue also... screen and camera is not so good.. nice mobile in this price range. comparatively nice specification on this price. tried lenovo first time and experience is not bad. one can go for it for as they are providing nice specification at this price. i brought this product at diwali offer.mobile is looks quiet good.13 mp camera front + 13+5 mp camera at back. result of front camera is ok/ggod in day light but not 13 mp wala good at night. rear camera waste.played need for speed no limits and game is running ok bug lags sometimes and graphics are worse.looks nice.i have problem with screen guard i haven\\'t find the exact due to curved screen at the edges.overall performance is good.it is mentioned that it comes with 15w charger but it has normal charger with 6ams good phone excellent the best mobile phone with nearly all features... phone is overheating problem,some times contact name changes automatically,and hang .but front and rear camera is v.good.i give this 4/10. battery backup issue otherwise it\\'s ok not that good i\\'m really disappointed with its performance jio is not working ,getting only speed less than 2 mbps .how to resolve? very good item but seller should include serial number model number imei number in the invoice, which is required for registering in the lenovo warranty. average performance mobile specifications are very good. also ram , internal memory and other specifications are very nice i liked the product very much bettary is low in with in the mineus blazing fast, average back camera, super selfi camera, avg. battery, good display, super sound network issue nice phone...with added features such as display look quality,dula cameras,selfie is also good.fingerprint sensor is also fast.battery is last almost for 1 day.overall good perfmance,decent look.also some negatives such as dosent show the headset symbol while insert a headset,little bit warms but dosent hang so far. battery back very worst & camera clearance not good, i tried return the product but they have condition for return , at least unable to the product.... feel very bad... lenovo k8 note have serious software issues -1.) mobile data is suspended always, you\\'ve to restart phone to use data.2.) there is no response from lenovo forum.3.) phone hangs in a while.4.) camera malfunction.5.) extremely poor performance, don\\'t go for lenovo products. nice mobile yaaaa,,its really waterproof mobile phone is good,but battery not goood, this phone does not support volte which handset i baught. dual rear cameras are very poor no image stabilization and cannot capture the moving objects, dolby atmos not good at all it doesn\\'t have good dolby effects. front camera is very good for selfies and battery backup is also good.. so be cautious about camera its not a camera phone best phone in this range batter draining fastlysystem gallary requiredhanging while notification alert cameperformance is also not up to the mark of 4gb ram , feeling like i\\'m using 1gb ram works like a charm :)good display, seamless performance, battery lasts for a day and half, plenty of storageneeds dual speaker to enjoy the dolby effectoverall 4.5 on 5 very very bad battery backup... battery capacity one dayradmi nota 4 two days battery capacity any sim deda on one sim or jio jim full network cutso this problem very bad amazing!! 😍 however the courier took nearly three weeks to deliver to me😞 overall it is good, what problem i am facing is battery backup is not up to the mark, even though it is 4000mah battery but it drains very fast, i can\\'t survive with it for whole day. in compare i was using 3000mah battery phone previously which is quiet impressive. also this device\\'s battery increase it\\'s temperature while charging. this is the worst got it today and i\\'m very disappointed with this device.front camera very very poor and takes blurr photos no details at all.if u r selfie lover please don\\'t buy this phone.k5 note is way better than k8 note. worse charger ever seen after 7 hour charging still not charged 100% . don\\'t buy. turbo charger also don\\'t work. go for other mobile and not this i purchased it 1month back,mobile auto network is not available, when 4g not available. i shifting it manually to 3g or 2g.but we need auto shifting. worst mobile.dolby atoms not working.not turbo charger.take more hrs to charge fully.irritating from bought not a great phone lenovo again dissapoints very good performance great mobile all features are great nice but backside 2nd camera was not good phone looks great, processor is currently the best in the industry with a decade core, camera quality is great.....i am currently happy buying this product.....would suggest to buy and enjoy...... battery is taking 4 hours to charge and getting drain in 6 hours. not something good for buying.also amazon has a cheating policy now a days for return and refund. they are asking for some local app to check the phone. which doesn\\'t have battery checking option. i bought lenovo k8 note to myself 2 weeks ago and i can say this without any doubt that it is the best phone in the price range of 12000 to 15000 rupees. i am so much satisfied with the performance of the phone in every aspect. the performance has been very good. the best thing about the phone is its camera function and the quality of screen along with dolby atmos surround sound.the look and design of the phone is however little average in comparison to other phones of sam price range. the look and design is very outdated. but it still seems decent.the biggest usp of the phone has been its features. it has 3gb ram with 32gb internal memory. it has a dolby atmos surround sound with 3.5 mm jack. the screen quality is also very good. it is available for a price of rupees 13000. the model with 4 gb ram and 64gb internal memory is available for 14000 rupees.the sound quality has been excellent. in fact, lenovo provides best sound quality in comparison to other phones.the phone give the feeling of a good value phone with some great features and nice looking body.it is a very user-friendly phone according to me.i would definitely recommend this phone everyone who are in search of a very good phone with great features in the price range of under 15000 rupees. i will rate this phone 4.5 out of 5 stars.it is definitely worth the value for money. the phone is awesome....its a killer phone for killer price....the camera could have been better other than that its top notch nice phone this phone are perform slow & power are decreased earlier. the camera performance are like much blur on back side. also find hitting issue on phone. company doesn\\'t give earphone duble turbo charger which are committed. charging also very slow it\\'s get around 1:30 hours but as per company committed it will take full charge with few minute battery back up very very poor quality.lenevo k6 power better then it... very best phone --battery back up is very good..fentastik look..selfish camera result is very best...but rear camera is not good as per accepted... very bedfirst battery and charger most important but 100% bettery charging time 7 (seven) hours& turbocharger is fake productdon\\'t by it ok great cameragreat note it is the best mobile it work like butter and amazon is grate nice mobile value & worth the mobile is good but the charger is not working at all purchased it few days ago fabulous sound quality, bt front camera is located at left hand side which will be a little disappointing for selfie lovers , cmra quality is best. good phone great camera. light weight. it has somany issues like1 no music app2 fill to mute option not available3 notification led issues4 notification settings issues can\\'t set5 keyboard language settings not available6 dolby atmos not usable7 facebook sync not available8 rotation wallpaper feature not working9 themes not available can\\'t customise icon or display10 cast screen not available for other than crime cast it have only one drawback as it deletes itself all downloaded media.please improve on that. sound problem nice it\\'s a very good smartphone worth every penny.pros:1. good battery backup and thanks to quick charging.2. camera quality is good. has good color capturing ability but do not expect 100% bokeh effect.3. feels little heavy but will get used to after some days. very good phone works good display/sound quality are good but for me major problems were:1. wifi connecting issue. (at same place lenovo k5 not is connected but k8 was just searching searching and searching)2. not fast charging (in 2 hours just 50% charged)3. when mobile data is on again wifi is having issues.4. where k5 note is having full jio mobile network k8 mobile is having just 2-3 signals. both cameras are good,sound and build quality also good. satisfied performance considering value i paid (11999 rs as diwali offer) i am unhappy to buy this , low features, bad battery, bad charger, no cast screen , no call recording it\\'s ok this is the third class phone i have ever seen, it has all the problems you know, worst camers, mice problem, network problem etc etc etc etc....., i want to return this product but dont know how to do it. camera is ok ok.. not effective.. charger is not also turbo..check second option if u think about to buy this one... the phone is good overall.but it has some heating issues.and the battery is not that good it is average.the camera works well.if you want a camera centric phone then go for it nice experience is good... respected sir, i am writing this to you to letting you know that i purchased lenovo k8 note on 21 of august.which cost me ₹12,999. and now with in 1 month the price of this phone decreased by ₹1000. which was very disappointing for me because i was one of the customers who showed interest in your product but after sometime you decreased the price. it seems like you don\\'t give importance to the customers who have faith on you. i hope you got my point and explain me the reason behind this. and also come with a solution of this problem.as well as it\\'s having scratch on its screen, since it is gorilla glass, not expected so early ..thankyou  dust can get in camera easily... lenovo should do proper camera packing in handset the phone is very good in terms of hardware and configuration, however, that on software part i didn\\'t find andoird nougat that good. it is lacking many features which its prior version lenovo k4 note was having.many essential features like gallery, phone recording etc. are missing. also, the screen has curved edges so i am not able to find a proper tempered glass till date. this phone is actually a motorola selling under the brand of lenovo. lenovo product k4 note was much better. for the price it is just ok very bad phone i updated it for the latest os oreo not to good battery draining fast and charging is taking more than 5 hours to charge from 30percent to 70 percent returned this product 2 times... turbo charger didnt worked in both devices good product purchased this on first day. no difference in moto and lenovo.now price has come down and reduced 3000/- . will lenovo give back the money.feels got cheated with lenovo nice mobile but sometime heating issue.. good very poor quality of charger(turbo charger). stopped working within one month of regular use. as directed by amazon we approached lenovo for replacement. though under warranty, their service centre is unwilling to replace it with a new one by giving various excuses like insisting for phone also to be returned back along with the charger. the phone is working fine only adopter needs to be replaced, then why are they insisting for phone i don\\'t understand. with normal charger it takes ages to fully charge. good product nice product. go for it. better than redmi note 4 in this price range. had network issues with it.network was very less as compared to my previous one plus 2 mobile phone.also had breaking voice during call.multiple times google apps could not start or load bla bla bla messages.finally returned the product.thanks to amazon excellent im not happy with the battery... it doesn\\'t last as it is supposed to. i had great expectations wen i ordered it but it was all a waste. i wont recommend anyone to buy this phone.. super product but camera z not satisfying very good smartphone at reosnabel price go for it ab tak ka sabse ghatiya product..dont buy it.k5 isse 50 guna jyada behtar hai. turbo charging?

replaced. but i am not satisfied with the options in the phone, viz. no screen shot facility, no cast screen, camera lighting is not good, no call recording, no gallery which is a default in all other phones. if these options are reviewed and updated by lenevo group, this phone is best. or otherwise i may be grateful if my phone is exchanged. i bought this through amazon. i am still having my lenevo a 7000, i am thinking to use that as if this is not updated with the above options. hope lenevo will look after this to have more buyers in future as i think lenevo is good in it\\'s price and performance. the phone is very good....i love it.... good one to use one small blue dot 5mm dia shown at the top center of the screen, permanently. i have received a defective phone yesterday-21-04-2018. how can i rectify. 4200 battery but does not last long ... touch is not so good gud heat up issue very sad network signal is very low and very bad i hate this camera, dolby atmos sounds and voice clarity is super good nice handset this prize, battery bacup is very well camera is good, should have provided more feature like reverse recording.sould quality is good.all basic

onwards phone is not charging battery is very poorheating good i am very happy with the performance of the phone (4gb variant) - have been using it for a few weeks now ..processor works fine, high end gamin works without a blip ... switching between applications is swift ..camera is better than my earlier sony phone, so please use your own bench marking for camera ..i recommend this phone .. amazing phone at this price range. camera is little bit disappointing. headphones socket and charging socket is little tight but overall it is value for money and would even give a tough competition to phones like one plus 3t. go for it undoubtedly. very much satisfied. it is hanging after an hour.. worst product. don\\'t buy it overall it\\'s a good phone but the camera quality and ram management was not up to the mark.yet if u want a allrounder it won\\'t disappoint u go for it.satisfied.....👍👍 very good wrost product, slow charging, heat up very fast ( some in denger position), bed network connectivityin short dont by this product just an amazing product. very nice sound and the camera is awesome. good phone but little bit hitting problem the phone gets heated very easily. worst experience with me for lenovo k8note ordered ,got software issues ,got replaced and second time same issue and phone automatically switch off, error in application,select boot mode, recovery mode, normal mode, phone ask me all this questions.when i call to customer care no resolution. don\\'t want to buy phones again on amazon..be careful others while buying a products on amazon. even

timely delivery camera, wifi & hotspot not working properly.call recording feature not available in phone. phone is good but battery is lost within a day, i\\'m very disopponted about battery. i never seen any lenovo mobile battery is very poor, pls don\\'t go far this one k6 power is much better than this one. nice. it\\'s amazing mobile ...touch response is verrrryyyyyyy nice ....and bettry backup also nice ....game works wonderfully..everything is fine ..thanks to lanovo k8 note. very good phone. just awesome camera quality is not so good.... otherwise it is good &battery backup is not good great battery.......good selfie camera......better than mi note 4 don\\'t know about the problems of other buyers but my phone is working as good as other devices in it\\'s competition this is the worst phone. in one month it\\'s start hanging you should buy mi a1 instead of this phone.this phones camera quality is not good as given my real experience..1 gud processor (no hang no intrupted gaming experience) loved it2 gud night camera (i compared it from other phones and took pics in a black room) nic shot i believe3 some. features still. miss in this phones (no show up of. battery %, internet speed) for this u have to download application.. but fine i have downloaded.. works great4 gaming experience (asphalt 8 almost 2gb game with high graphics.. there is no hang in it even also when i play clash of clans and asphalt 8 simultaneously by minimising one downbest choice for this range price.. ok not bad but something is missing on the price range its ok don\\'t buy..many of d applications like facebook and instagram didn\\'t respond frequently.even management of ram is very poor...though i bought of 4 gb ram, after installing very view n basic applications only 800 mb remains free...better go for xiaomi note 4 best camera in this price range. the power button doesn\\'t seem durable. worst phone in market lenovo k8 note which is in amozon. over heat... battery drains 3 hrs in normal calls. no videos no games no music...poor phone in lenovo...pls don\\'t buy in amozon...it is 420....pls visit showrooms and take other phones but not lenovo k8 note !!!!! good phone ! with great features ... go for it hang and heat problem while using camera continuously. awesome handset, everything is perfect in this budget, and it is made in india! lenovo k8 note is best mobile in this price. satisfied with the product lenovo k8 note.. system is also good worst product. mainly speaker problem.. two speakers are not working normally.. overall it\\'s a good phone.. i like it. picture quality is good. some time it hanged on. compare to other products it is of course good for this price . battery is enough for one day only. best phone , excellent camera quality, good battery service, and excellent processor 😊😊 don\\'t waste money buying this, lenovo k8 note 13 mpxl camera doesn\\'t even give you redmi 5 mpxl camera quality and night photos are really bad. heating is another issue, when you play games or record a video it gets heat. also the battery is not that great, turbo charging takes about 1.5hrs to charge and it drains fast. my suggestion go for other brands which has a sony low light enhancer (sensor) if you are looking for a camera phone.and this product you cant return and you have to go with it once you buy it. think before you buy. it\\'s good best phone h lenovo k8 very good mobile i so impressed love u lenovo k8 note not good after 6moths it\\'s hang. camera clarity is gud ...fingerprint response gud ...sometimes phone lags when usage of multiple apps ...worth the money ...but dont expect too much for 14k.... average phone best quality and upgraded phone in lowest price u can change any song to ringtone.just put the song into ringtone folder ☺️but my problem 1-jio sim is not working in idle mod.😢 heating problem battery life is as good as expected sabse waste phone. lenovo is telling it\\'s a killer phone but it\\'s a dead phone. don\\'t waste your money nice phone totally impressed nice camera but not satisfied with second camera exchanged with my k3 note the service was very fast v purchased this item in two montgs back, while charging the phone heats up, unfortunately v have not missed the duration of returning the package, i feel no qualify control of this product, worst very nice. i want to resend the cash memo of this product nice budget phone with a better processor than sd625 which is used in other phones in this price range. no lagging, great sound, decent camera and a good battery makes it all in one phone.if compared to redmi note 4, k8 note have many advantages.1. better low light camera2. dual camera for depth mode3. better sound4. music key which can be customised further5. 13mp front camera wid flash for better selfies6. stock android and better updates7. dolby atmos8. inbuilt vr support9. included 15w turbo charger and support display and camera are not so good. prefer samsung for good display. i love this phone i received a defective piece or problem in lenovo i don\\'t... i have purchased lenovo k8 plus model no lenovo k8 plus (xt 1902-2). this is my first experience with lenovo. lenovo mobile and lenovo customer support service is very very bed. i used lenovo k8 plus last 3 month in these months the mobile become in very bed condition...the battery is not working full

stock android13 mp front and back cameradolby atmosless heatingvr split modecons: poor secondary cam(5mp)updatesnormal built qualityno ir blasterbattery consumingfinally price to performance phones seems ok but not the best battery is heating up very quickly and charging very slowly. also discharging very fast even when it is idle. product is of very bad quality. not worth for the price what we pay.by the time i realize return date is also closed. nice good product in my mobile if i call someone they can\\'t hearing what i\\'m speaking network issue, phone heating during charging, taking more than 2hrs for charging. good one but jio sim problem persist as mentioned by otherspls rectify it lenovo. good one. camera quality is good.battery backup also nice.theatre max awesome.using it since last 1 month.no problem at all.overall a very good product to buy, but also consider other options which are available at the same price. phone slowed down after 2 months use, nobody accepts its software update or any servicing at lenovo care centre, ot they ask for 1500-2000 rs extra , as it was purchased online, so as per them its not lenovo product and doesnot comes under warrenty, disgusting attitude of lenovo personal. amazon should stop selling lenovo phones. how to use b&w mode..... nice product very bad product of lenovo.after use of 7 days it\\'s one speaker is failed.waste of money and very bad service of amazon for pick up facility.shame on u amazon phone get heat up quickly amazing phone. delivery on time. best phone for 14k. i am purchased lenovo k8 note mobile 3 no\\'s.but one mobile some time automatically switch off, so my product change urgently. bluetooth speaker does\\'t work with it.battery back suck. it goes 15 to 1% just in 3 minutes.mobile

automatically and after replace same product from seller and again i faced same issue and finally returned this product .also faced heating issue. bad product. poor battery as it doesn\\'t last for 8 hours. nd co. is claiming 1.5 days battery backup. 14000 wasted. first dolbyatmos not working as expected. really much disappointed from lenovo company. i bought only for music killer experience but fake. i need solution from lenovobattery backup not good as 4000mah.nice camera\\'s both rear & front. good everything is ok except second sim because it doesn\\'t support 4g network. could have given 5star but the processor ain\\'t so good as compared to mi a. good morning sir, i vinod received the item on 23 oct 17. now today while charging i found that it is not charging, it start charging when i change its usb cable with another usb cable, however charger is working fine. so kindly deliver me another usb cable for lenovo k8 note if possible. i will be very thankful to you. camera is not good.waste of money. it\\'s wonderful small small problems is there.when contacts is open phone was hanging worst experience, i purchased lenovo k8 note in the first flash sale from amazon.in. i was very excited to catch the phone that\\'s why i ordered the phone with \"fast delivery option\" but when received, it was worst experience. its name is killer note just because it will kill your expectations, excitement.i did compare charging with my another phone, charge percentage and duration were similar on both phones.1. phone heats badly during charging, browsing etc. 43-degree celsius temperature is dangerous. the device can be blast.2. corning gorilla glass!!!!! noticeable major scratches on the display within a week while i am a very light user.3. no nano coating. finger\\'s stains visible on the screen.4. turbo charging does not work. battery discharge very fast the mobile is very good but some issue on mobile. 1-all contact not seen on contact display. 2-play music dual speakers not working.3-call setting not built-in setting. very bad product problems in bluetooth connectivity . i think bluetooth hardware is not of good quality bola hai corning gorilla glass bc microsoft 535 mera unginat bar gira h firbhi uska glass nhi tuta ek crack bhi nhi aaya patthar pee kha kha gira h pr ye lenovo ek bar kya gir gaya aadhe glass ko crack aaya don\\'t buy gyzzzz bichme hang bhi hota hai kbhibhi switch off but time ke bad hota hai fir i would rate it 2 star, being at price of 14000, it doesn\\'t have gallery and music app which we need to search from play store and even though after installing several apps, i am not satisfied with the 3rd party apps as compared to by default manufacturer.also, it comes with fast charging mode but taking 8 hour to charge from it\\'s 15watt adapter.in 14000, there are so many options available and which are far better than this, best is go with redmi..... very good not worth its cost. heating issue is there and battery is drying fast excellent product. am using it for almost a month now but no problem at all. good very bad experience with amazone, they sale defective pieces in offer and not give replacement,i bought lenovo k8 note it\\'s ear speaker not working, hot mobile return or replace items poor product , i had to return it because of heat issue which was extremely bad . camera was good although not satisfied with the cameraand display.their no difference between normal camera and depth focusing. .try to update the camera and some other features.and provide a system update for k8 note users. . good , no heating , good performance, good camera. sound quality compare to k6 is not good , waiting for software fix from lenovo the product is good build study in hand and feels good but due to mediatek the ideal battery drain is high the 40000 mah battery should give at lest 1& half day of battery life but that\\'s not the case it\\'s just good for one day of use with moderate usage .... overall the phone is powefull and a good overall package the screen glass not as tough ... i use an iphone and an k4 note on android befor this k8 and this one got two deep gashes on screen with normal usage of keeping it in the pocket .. k4 screen was much durable than this ... u better buy a screen guard along with this phone ... it take longer to access files and photos when u put in 128gb card .. also startup time lags after u download a few apps etc ... not worth k8 should increase quality than k4 but in this phone it\\'s reverse ... looking forward to my experience at service centre will post it later dont waste ur money by buying this crap...u may focus on the cost and feautres and get easily jealous to get this phone...u will regret as i did...one of the worst phn..already i have retuned the same as per amazonpolicy..defect in battery.charging and heating issues...the saddest part is im getting a new same handset again pretty well immersed with an optimum performance lenovo made a great piece.1 great performance2 battery is long lasting3 great in hand feel4 built in quality is superb5 i loved it.all above things are mentioned as looking at the price point of view

capability poor as compared to k5 plus at same palace 4, tap to sleep can be provided awesome phone but camera is not so good this is good mobile and i never seen this features any mobile below 15000 price thank you lenovo for this product good products best buget phone within 15-20 minutes it is getting hot and hanging very poor quality superb first two months no problem but after battery heat, charger problem and mobile will be hang, i can\\'t belive this so i am dissappointed to this product superb phone, does not hang or heat with normal use. there are issues with 4g and needs to synch with operator. i think i got a defective peace, battery life is very poor and when you plug-in your handsfree in handset it\\'s not showing any symbol on phone very cool phone...🤗🤗 product is good but not so much features in phone. its better to purchase mi note 4 instead of this phone. only two extra features in this phone front camera with flash and extra memory card slot. as per my opinion feature wise red mi note far better than this phone. awesome phone. great look. no lags. camera quality is just okay, not too good. sound quality is also nice.only disadvantage is that there are no highlighted back button/home button. it becomes difficult to operate your phone in dark room. no 4 gnetwork support for mobile battery is not upto mark ...signal prob is also there. ok but volume is bad, charging default only one day without using data simply great need perfect head set useless reply from from customer service representative side.it is charging issues.please don\\'t buy this

3 signal bars . even if other 4g mobile shows full signal.and lot of small features are missing compared to lenovo vibe ui such as night brightness mode , schedule reboot.camera is good.battery is sufficient for full day with heavy usage.turbo charger helps to charge quickly.sound quality is loud but not as good as compared to lenovo k5 note. best phone 4ram/64rom but camera thoda aur badiya hota to 5 star rating ata just ok, i am issuing 3 problems1) battary drains fast (for continous usage it comes 3-4 hours, for only calling & rare usage it comes 12 hrs.)2) turbo charger charges the mobile 0 to 80 % in 80 minuts & 80 to 100 % it takes 45 minits to one hr. or even more time)3) depth sencing camera i.e. 5 mp rare camare does not work purfect.these are 3 problems iam facing.expect

processor is awesome . it\\'s wonderful phone and affordable camera quality is good and batray backup is also good and sound quality of this phone amazing......... amaging product.... decent phone, not built for rough usage,build looks good but slips from your hand,display lacks brightness in apps, but adaptive display just gr8,battery, front camera, supercharging, speakers are fantastic. just an above average phone.. though it does look good, the display is pretty average. it takes a lot of time to boot and the camera is nothing to feel happy about.. superb and very good... thanks amazon

good mobile phone,easy to used,low price & vary good features excellent phone in affordable budget. instead of dual camera company should concentrate on single powerful camera at back & front with

lagging in game,performance also good...battery average, but within this budget this is very good phone. super performance avarage battery back up very poor, sound quality is also not good. no one should go with this lenovo k8 note. great phone , good value for money.prosdual cameraseparate memory cardhuge batteryfast charging 1 battery life is not so good if ur heavy user this is not suitable for u2 camera depth mode is not good.3 basic function like gallery, music player is not available. assessed my google photos and music player.4 hanging while mult tasking.5 cast screen is not working.6 ovet heating issue also is there.apart from the some negative points some cool features available in this phone.please think before buy is product. good product phone with best features in the budget. felt comfortable while using the handset. battery is good,no lag while using the mobile the only problem is rear camera, it takes to time focus on the objects with the rear camera. i hope lenovo would resolve this issue with the upcoming updates . apart from this every thing is great. best to buy under 15k everything is good except battery backup..only 1day battery backup... well i m writing this review after using this phone for 5 days. well this phone is not my first choice i want to buy redmi note 5 pro but flash sale goes out of stock in blink of eye so i ordered this device. what i have concluded after using this-1.no lagging issue.2.no heating issue.3.battery backup is good but not as good like redmi note 4 which have the same size battery 4100 mah.4.camera is average if u guyz looking for depth mode or bokeh effect in this device then u feel disappointed because the image taken in depth mode is poor. it hardly recognize the subject and it sometimes blur the edges of subject. while the mi a1 and mi note 5 pro gave the best portrait mode and bokeh effect in the same price category.5.front camera is 13 megapixels but the image taken look like just 5 megapixels camera have taken it. it have no sharpness and clear picture like 13 megapixels phone.6.if u like listening songs and watching movies then u have the benefits of dolby atmos sound system which gave good quality bass in the headphones. dolby atmos equalizer provide the true sound and bottom speaker is also good with clear voice.7.turbo charger is the only name thing it took almost 2 hours to fully charge the phone.overall i got this phone in 11k price which i found good to buy this device but if u are looking for camera than go for mi a1 or note 5 pro which is only 2k or 3k costlier than this phone but u have to go through the flash sale which again disappointment by redmi.i only got this device because it have dual sim + memory card system and dolby atmos support and it is cheaper than other phones with same features.i hope u found this review helpful. rear camera is not working from day 1. it\\'s been 1 week that i am trying to contact any concerned person from amazon to comment & correct the same.please respond.. very bad product never buy it\\'s waist of money very fast smartphone great phone for gamers and camera is good amazing product like amazon.excellent condition and product.thank you 😊. this is the 3rd lenovo phone that i am using in the last 2-3 years started off with lenovo vibe k4 note, k8 plus and now k8 note. i am disappointed as wifi is not pairing property even after factory reset it is erratic. at times net pack also not pairing and if paired through wifi or netpack then the speed of the ram which is 4 gb is below par. seriously thinking of returning it. not happy with the mobile at all. this must be the 10th mobile i bought through e commerce sites and first time a bad experience. good average battery life looking nice to much camera is music is best reasonable price with great features. battery drain very fast disappointed very bad phone full battery doesn\\'t last for more then 3 hours performance and battery is good

the money spent, camera quality is bad and battery doesn\\'t last a day instead being 4000mah. processor used is hello x20 not x23 . they are cheating. nice phone. good selfies too much heating issue, does not get charged after 6 hours. wrost product ever by leveno. now i am facing issue in returning sice they just provide replacement not return, then why do they have return policy. it should be replacement policy instead. very good mobile in this range. touch is very smooth and battery backup is average. camera is also too good and processor is excellent. overall very nice product. no headphones issues awesome good speed. quick charging and good battery backup. headset is not given the phone camera is avg. and heats a little even at little usage battery and volume is fine though

good.. good to buy. battery is not good screen cast doesn\\'t work with smart tv worstttt phone.i purchased on 01.09.2017 within one month time its giving problems.today display is gone and it is not power-on even try again and again.what to do? please advise. nice camera picture quality and smooth touch screen very good nice job did by seller nice battery will not sustain 8hr nice and powerful experience.... camera needs to be improved.. battery is quite good... waiting for oreo update... need some bugs fixed... good product but sudden price drop to 14k to 13k is partiallity to buyers...just like me 😅😅 nice the earphones are not fitting wellbut did not returnand the smrt chk also a waste app for physical connection.plz tell me there any option to check music by earphone honest review.its a good phone deserves a 4 star specially buying it with exchange offers makes it damn worry of price.built is a bit average.camera quality is lot better and functioning is smooth.lenovo offering stock android is what it made me buy this phone.overall it\\'s a worth to buy phone. everything about the phone is horrible - battery life, speed, problem in restarting & wifi connection, lack of depth effect in camera pictures (dual camera is for namesake only).i think i have been given a defective piece in the flash sale. the return window is showing closed now. really want to know how i can return this handset and get rid of this painfully slow phone. just superb!! loving it good . informed it will come by 30 th tuesday but arrived 3 days before itself nyc product by lenovo. worst product display was not good it was broken just fall at low high best mobile under this range proper network issue in this product. poor camera quality. dual camera is showoff only. color combination not matching with original. software level volte optimize not hardware volte. worst phone...charging problem nice phone at this price. baddest mobile ever only problem about camara all other is ok this smartphone is the best for its processing..... gaming is wonderful, primary as well as secondary camera is nice....and lastly it\\'s battery performance is best i did not received earphones with my mobile! and also the screen gard! dear team i am request to return bu not complet super phone in this rate received as shown in portal.. also observed fast delivery...... tnx performance wise not goodpice was very hiting problem when charging , calling & net usingloud speekar is very low loved it. everything is great in this price range except the sound quality from speakers. its good but not like the lenovo k4 note.camera is awesome. it takes nice photos both in daylight and night time. dont buy this phone, its having update problem, its not volte. i am using this phone.. very nice product lay bharilenovo mobile no 1 mobile awesome phone very good battery photo quality is good only video is little dull overall phone is very good and amazon delivering is very fast n excellent great phone love it.... good. good phone (+) picture and sound quality is excellent.battery power is wonderful. it stands for nearly two days.(-) for full battery charging it took nearly minimum three hours worst product again from lenovo family. i thought that it\\'ll be a camera centric phone and camera quality would be awesome but this phone has disappointed me at a large scale. i\\'ll not suggest to buy this phone. coolpad cool 1 is a good option at this price range. i\\'m sharing two picture one is in daylight and other in dark room respectively. it is very nice product, looking is awesome, performance is very good and strong enough overall it is best in the price range nice product ... nice phone charger not supporte, phone was not good have mobile network problem. very worst mobile lenovo k8 superb very nice deca core processor in this range,camera,game performance,full hd screen awesome.only one thing bad that no miracast playing in this device and blutooth connectivity problem with tv otherwise nice phone good protect . picture quality is very well. mobile heat problem i feel awesome product in this price segment better than moto g5s plus best for selfie... & music my phone has a lot of issues. the battery drains very fast and it takes a lot of time to charge the same. there are a lot of screen burn-in issues as well. i went to service center as well but the problem is still not solved. i need a replacement mobile is over heating and the charging goes down rapidly heat issue is more. otherwise nice mobile dolby app missbhaveing this was a very bad mobile phone....1. very low battery backup.2. no call recordings.3. network problem.4. you can\\'t take pictures with finger print sensor and side keys.5. can\\'t set ringtones other from device like a song.6. anable to edit images (there is no tools for this) etc... it\\'s too good and faster than other phones am much pleased with the performance without data being on, battery is fantastic. this is the only reason why i purchased this. next are 4, 64 and cg glass. touch screen is super sensitive. right now i am using a single sim. with a double sim battery backup needs to be checked.not recommended for those who look for a good camera, and feature rich phone. camera colour reproduction is really poor indoors. recommended redmi note 4 over this. i am unable to add a contact in sms without converting it into mms. can be done in moto g series. battery pack up is not up to the mark.remaining everything is finr phone have heating problem while charging with onboard charger , nothing special in it better go for samsung . done big mistake by buying this phone. good nice phone a very good phone for speed and spacebut as a very powerful phone of 10cores battery drains easily phone\\'s battery started draining at faster pace after one month of use very hot games charg finish shotly the phone is great !! lasted for almost 1 n half day! no problem in anything..just perfect ! awsmmeee...phone software problem.. volte not support properly needed head phone volte tech not support for 4g voice calls.... it does not support screen mirroring and call recording...rest everything is fine nice phone with good battery life and good performance... product received promptly and as described. this phone works fine, im new to stock android this ui of the phone is very impressive. if a person not a hardcore gamer then dont think... buy it. it automatically goes off eventhough battery is full. i have to restart again. it\\'s been only 19 days since purchase. pls exchange this is a really great smartphones. good job by lenovo nice front camera 😍 good phone and nice bettery, but perform weard sometime. but value for money product. nice phone.... battery backup is not good enough ...i want another in replacement of this... it\\'s not that much good in camera. yes, it\\'s also heating quickly . from this my previous handset lenovo vibe k5plus was better in single camera exllent heating issue.battery didn\\'t like that 4000 mah.5v, 3a turbo charger used to charge the full battery within a hour.at the same time it will be discharges quickly.back camera is low qualityfront camera ok.nice platform with deca core.decent displaydolby atmos superif you want to long battery phone... don\\'t buy this. otherwise it is better than other mobiles compare this price range. mobile is very good but battery draining is like a bullet train.... that\\'s the only problem.... i dont received head phone (ear phones) in box. received from darshana electronics. everything is going fine for a while but only problem is with battery not upto mark i have started phone, suddenly charger burnt.phone is good but very poor quality of charger very good turbo charge has stopped working apparently due to which it takes around 6 hours to charge the phone. normal phone very bad service and very bad accessories my charge is not working not after 1months :v nice phone there is a problem with charging. first 15 days it was ok. but now the charging has slowed down and it show the same 40% even after 1 hour of charging. lenovo need to look into this issue very soon. my return time too over. otherwise i would have returned the product immediately.please suggest if there is any solution to this. never expected this kind of issue...... very nice smart phone, good feature... excellent phone.very good service by amazon. nice one at this price.display is superbno heatinggood cameragood sounds qalitybut battery drain rapidly is some cons the fool\\'s giving reviews before usage after using a month they got the truth.the worst product ever.just giving the configuration but not performing.so make a wise decision.for replacement u\\'ve only 7 days. very trendy and handy awesome degrading my previous review now after 3 months usage to 1 star. at 10core processor all game lag at starting first play. games get collapsed in between which is annoying and frustrating. battery giving 3-4hours on screen time on normal usage. battery automatically discharging . now heading towards customer care. it\\'s not a lasting product and didn\\'t meet expectations atleast it should be fine working till 6 months anyways now. very good mobile is already use, there is no sim tray pin in the box, and no back cover good phone...bt some heating issue... sometimes turbo charging does not work properly...bt charge stays more or less 1 day...front camera is very good..bt wrt to the dual camera , back camera should have been more better...otherwise a good phone..no hanging issue..or no problem in it best product @ best price amazing i am using this product from last 37 days it is a pathetic phone with issue of display from day one and around 2 days back more problems aroused the phone suddenly get discharged at 50% and gets switched off also on recharging it does not recharges, please keep yourself away from this junk of a product i am conned and does not want you all to be conned, also at service center they will only format your phone and update software in spite of you complaining of the display problem, i am facing the problem since last 37 days but for them the problem does not exist what a joke and fooling tricks these guys are trained for,lenovo has made a junk and no other word fits better and above that the service team is a con stars employed just to fool the buyers so please resist yourself and buy anyother product instead my suggestion.highly upset with the whole experience no earphones were to be found inside the box.i want it to be delivered to my address as soon as possible not so good at this price good but speaking time phone releases head lenovo always *****4000 mah but only 8 - 10 hr backup ,turbo charger 2-3hr to full charge ,heating , stuck , slowi\\'m writing this review after 4 moths of usage.thanks lenovo very poorly activity heat problem and early battery low very nyc ram management and the processing speed is amazing ...at the beginning there was a lil difficulty in camera but it has been rectified in further updates ...finger print sensor works great....sound quality is pretty amazing not surprised since it is dolby my phone has connectivity issue can\\'t connect with any device specially laptops all are good but it has heating issue.getting heated so fast within 30 mins hanging and not responding camera quality good do you know, the amazon.in exchange value for this mobile bought 4 months before from amazon.in is 1603/- mrp 13999/-don\\'t worry lenovo, i\\'ll award you the worst of all 2017 award for your kg knowledge innovation, even that failed.this is to lenovo & team, may the rest to know about lenovo.this is my ever first product of lenovo bought on the very first sale, i regret for that and this is my last product of lenovo.the device has decta core (10) but performance wise it\\'s quad core, may be less but sure not more.it has software issues, frequently shows crash error which irritates users to the peak. \"process system isn\\'t responding\"bluetooth distracts, many have raised this issue in lenovo forum but nothing useful from lenovo & team ( better concentrate your engineering team before releasing every product), users are not your beta testers. one user provided the solution which seems to be work good but nothing by lenovo ( your service & quality proves here ).wifi hotspot the most hot issue raised by several users in the forum but the reply from lenovo says out team couldn\\'t duplicate the issue please do post us the info. even when millions of data given nothing is going to happen. one user gave the solution which isn\\'t applicable to all.camera updates isn\\'t good, too bad. worthless to have these much of megapixels as hardware alone.better review your product before releasing in to the market, hate lenovo.i definitely swear not to recommend your product anytime. good osm phone ever camera quality super sound good 10 core processor😘😘 very poor handset in turbo charging. only 2% increase in 5 min. i suggest all of you not purchase it. little disappointed in battery duration otherwise all is gud nice mobile, as per expectationslet\\'s see how it\\'s worked ahead i liked this phone. in terms of durabilty lenovo rocks. but this phone doesn’t have an option to super cast or cast with tv. this is a major drawback!!i usually watch movies on phone amd would like to cast it and watch over my tv. but this phone doesnt support. hence requesting lenovo support to release an update to make this supercast working.also in terms of network stability, feels like the antenna is not strong enough. value for money..👍 how to custom ringtone set ??? custom ringtone ka option hi nahi he sirf company ki ringtone set hoti he ,custom ringtone setting option hi nahi he lenovo k8note third class mobile he ,leke pachatava ho raha he overall the phone is really good.the charger cord we received is defective. when you plug the charger in it doesn\\'t work at all. the machine is working fine. we have to use cord for some other mobile.please let me know how to get this changed??? fine very good product by lenovo value for money didnt like it...charging takes a hell lot of time... and they call is turbo chargingcamera is very ok..okish....even though it has dual cameraselfie cam is a wastespeed ok..ok...looks very bulky not at all recommended...u can get many good cellphone in this range... pls dnt buy this in a spot sale trapit s a trap...dnt buy and waste

some one give it. free .... it\\'s good phone. worth it for the price. good quality display and performance. but the accessories on amazon for this phone is not very convincing and not much available yet. it\\'s having some sort of heating issueand also camera clearity is not too good camera is average , handset is lte( notvolte) amazing features in best price nice look, well function and really a fine phone. sup and excellent quality of camera network issuelenovo customer care support is also not thereas well as calls are not connecting and signal is showing but for others it is getting switch off who are calling me....waste of 💰 money waste to buy this phone. wanted to give negative rating but it\\'s not practically possible. buying this phone was one of the worst decisions ever taken by me. the phone worked well initially, however, the heating issue started to show early and kept worsening with every day use. further after updating to android oreo, now phone gets heated insanely after few minutes of use. also battery gets drained quite frequently. don\\'t waste your precious money on this piece of shit. mobile is no doubt gud but its showing its 4g handset and offer with idea but idea network didn\\'t recognize this handset even 4g is not working and not eligible for 4g handset offers. phone is ok but there is problem with change....it is taking too much tym to charge it best phone no star rating bettry is to power. only for half day as i am using the phone from the last one find i don\\'t find any big flaws.build quality is good aluminium series 6000 looks finethe camera is very good.battery last for 1.5 days you cant expect more than this.overall it\\'s a great phone. dear staff i need headphones not there in box battery is bad. everything else is good. punda phone 😂 its actual usb of the mobile is camera batter sound stock android ans soo on but its really worst in these segments.dont trust these kinds of promotions hangs in every few minute, phone shaking problem. bluetooth not working properly i will not suggest anyone to go to this phone .... fed up with lenovo, i was happy with one plus it was 100% perfect. tried for the first time bad experience. heating probably leave k8 note good product redmi phones are lot more better than k8 note. this phone more hot during normal usage the phone is working the best i fell love with it worst phone ever... don\\'t have basic apps like gallery and automatic call recordingand battery drains very quickly even in battery saver is onk4 note is more better than thisor else take lenovo x overall good but problem with connectivity.... it has very low range of wifi connection. good product reached safe have been using the lenovo k8 note now for over 4 months, overall its a good phone but it was very disappointing to find out that the cast screen option doesn\\'t work. camera is decent. can play heavy games without any lag. has basic heating issues that every phone has, nothing major though. could overlook the heating issue for that matter. 3 android updates received since i bought it but still didn\\'t have any fixes for the cast screen. loving stock android. after 3 months of use, after paying 14k for this phone, i would say don\\'t buy it. camera has worst quality in this price range. when you view photos taken from this camera on computer then you will understand. also no inbuilt gallery app. google photos compresses photos reducing quality. battery backup reduced after latest update.no 4k video recording. never buy it battery is very baddraining in standby mode very fast specifications are very attractive but the user interface is very bad, lenovo k8 note is lacking of1 no inbuilt call recorder2 no compass3 you can not cast screen4 no trash cleaner like other lenovo handset has this generation phone, nothing is unsatisfying rather than the battery, as far as 4100 mah is concerned it should stay a lil bit more. it\\'s very bad fantastic product, very happy. mobile is good but the delivery is too bad.... awsome lenovo k8 note mobile is dammage mobile. no buy more friends. my mobile is very problem see fine gold.after one week of use, completely satisfied with the product. best phone (overall) in this price range.looks 5/5battery 5/5sound 5/5display 5/5front camera : 4.5primary camera: 4.5 worst experience of heating issue in this phone, average phone. nicely packed got early than actual delivery date. when i checked warranty in lenovo support it says only 11 months. battery not lasting for 16 hrs continues usage, very bad. slightly heating. smart look. high performance. more features in less cost. heats up only when on charging. overall it is a good deal. nice facing following problems even after software upgrade:1. sound is breaking when connected to bluetooth speaker. not sure whether the phone is faulty or it\\'s a software bug.2. charging very slow, if using mobile while charging.3. camera quality is not up to the mark. depth effect are poor. however front camera is nice.4. poor graphics performance while playing games like clash royale, plant vs zombies, etc.. not tried heavy graphics games, like asphalt 8.5. disappointed with music quality, even with dolby. music quality was superb in k4note.6. trusted face detection is poor.7. music quality is poor with my beats bluetooth headphones.8. surprised when i came to know that nfc is not there in this phone.9. not able to receive calls on jio, if phone sits ideal for 10-15 min.totally disappointed with this phone. wasted my money. please don\\'t buy this crap.i love lenovo k4note, and will switch soon. good deal...worth it no heatingfast charging is goodafter 15days no hanging issue till nowdaily usage 12 to 15 hoursi feel it\\'s very good prosgood cameraspeedy

phone that i ever seen. best phone ever i have used better than redmi note 4. i don\\'t know why my model is not letting me upgrade to android oreo, whereas it is supposed to give me the option to upgrade. moreover, i had upgraded to oreo in the same model just 5 days back but due to system issues i had to get that replaced. in the new set which i got it is not giving me the same option which i had got in the previous handset of same model. this is really strange. it was just awesome.. writing the review after using it for daysbattery is excellentuser interface is goodfinger print works very

better than this are availablebut still it can competeheating is the only issue i\\'ve found after six months battery draining issue worste phone price is dropped in buy after days i upgraded my phone from redmi note 3 to this phone. frankly i love the design and look of this phone, venom black is gorgeous. overall a good phone. i find the screen quality a bit washed off, and battery backup is like it has got a 2500 mah battery. and the depth mode of camera is killing me. i bought it for the dual camera but it turns out to be a fraud. please improve the focus mode and battery backup. the product is damaged. killer best phone at this price. if you are bluetooth lover never buy this.bluetooth device gets connected but nothing gets play wheater it\\'s audio or video.it\\'s an average. it\\'s just updated from it\\'s previous version dut to competition in feild.phone looks premium...good battery backup as of now...back camera not so good, if we compare with k5 note and k6 note back camera is not so good and not updated...shortcut features are not so good...audio jack size is small i think so...overall it\\'s average...just a small suggestion to lenovo inc. if possible start providing earphones... two sim issue,gets hot, otherwise ok.go for motorola g5 plus instead. today i receaved this device.looking good device.but i bit disappointed when not receaved earphone with it. liked very much. k8 is great for capturing photos . the build is rugged but is not good looking especially the front view . camera can do better if the software is tweaked especially portraits .battery is good and cahrging is fast , awaiting oreo update which may improve the battery lifeeffortlessly multitasks and dedicated music key is cool feature .photographs are quite interesting and nice in daylight , in low light very grainyjust an update - the screen cracked , don\\'t know how ! corning gorilla glass not effective - i had put additional screen guard as well . not a good phone to buy. heating and battery dranage problem after update.. the mobile phone was delivered yesterday or 15/5/2018 on checking i found that the earphone socket is not working excellent service, before time received the product, as committed by website product is same. very satisfying overall good buy for the price i paid. not a good mobile phone..heavy heating problem in mobile... wireless headphones not work well with this phone black out screen after purchasing. beytary is bed. nice mobile i want.... invoice of my product overall it is a very good phone... best mobile for this range its nice mobile. i need exchange my redmi4 mobile 3gd/32gb. purchased 3 month. expect more money best feature phone extremely slow booting. no stock gallery!! no stock calculator ! doesn\\'t support call recording apps. camera not good. lenovo k8 smartphone good but package is bad not found head phone in package.so not good online\\'s shopping better take in mobile store is good after 1.5 months the charger is not working.wow amazon giving away faulty and cheaper products i think. nice worst battery10%/an hourwhile drains immediately...no return facility available... if we go for return option.... they suggest url for technical support amazing product using this product for two weeks everything is good the only thing is that the turbocharger is a bit slow in charging and no handsfree is provided with it very poor camera quality and poor battery. awesome phone by lenovo..my first lenovo phone, i must say 1st impression is last impression.camera 9/10battery 9/10gaming 10/10 tested nfs,mortal combat etcsound 10/10 dolby rocks plz use better headphones for dolby effectdisplay 10/10 superb display qualitycharging 10/10 super fast charging beats moto phones too smooth touch ,nonlag whatsoever, camera is gud......gud phone if bought at discount not impressive if compared to redme note 4 n other products in similar range... good phone in low budget. but after 4 to 6 months usage i got 2 times software problems satisfied with camera and battery life nice phone with great camera quality and storage. superb device. survive quality is not better totally failed to my expectations. even has not silent mode shortcut. buy 7 k phones. those will be better than it. dolby atmos is not working.how to fix thisfrom where to get support from lenovo.seal of outeramazon package (outer package) was open but set was seal.bit disappointed with dolby atmos not functioning.hope you will cooperate battery super, no heating issue, fast charging, smoothly working, but camera is not as expected. lots of hitting issues & networking problem awesome i love it. exellent performance lenovo k note8 making problem as over heating, battery exhaust fast also network not support at my native place mau whenever lenovo k6 not run without any problem. i complain but not shortout my problem. it\\'s a very good product.and i liked amazon service too packs a punch of all necessary features.. this phone is good i purchased this phone yesterday and rear 13 mp camera is not working... even when i start \\'depth enable\\' function then camera is stuck and then you have to restart mobile to use the camera again... very bad experience, even now i cannot return this mobile n customer care says your problem will be troubleshooting and get resolve... do not purchase this mobile ever.. good sir within 15 days of this item purchased , fault noticed in hearing. while approaching service centre authorised, they informed that hearing speaker is not working and if any warranty it may be repaired. kindly confirm what i have to do ? moreover no warranty certificate/ invoice are enclosed with your order information. worst ... please don\\'t buy... waste of money...even 1 also i won\\'t give.. good mobile phone very good phone..... good very delicate product. awesome mobile . it\\'s been 2 months since i bought this mobile. amazing battery life and camera performance.. worth for money ... not very impressive like mi functions not easy to use. my phone is restart often. camera is good only this i like about this phone. after all not happy with product super smooth and best in its price band. i\\'m not really satisfied with this lenono k8 note device.. device getting so heat not getting charge fast.... even very difficult to call on this device as that heat hurt ears👂.. preforms good.device is bit heavy. battery drain very quickly it is good product nice phone not meet my expectations with lenovo. paid extra for one day delivery. but rec\\'d after two days. excellent the battery back up will make you cry. a deca-core processor not supported by battery back is just not acceptable. it does not last even half a day. the ultra fast charging is a hoax. it does not charge from 15% to 100% in anything less than 6-7 hours. good phone but one problem no gallery 5 star means 5 out of five... i would give less than one star for this phone. very bad signal receiving capacity. after purchasing this phone i have a smart phone with no proper internet connectivity. jio signal and internet works perfectly fine with my wife moto g4 phone. this really sucks.i would strongly recommend not to go for it. hey.. i also bought this phone & after 3 days of usage.. i think the phone is good. the rear camera is not too good bt the front cam is awesome. battery backup is superb. stock rom is really very good. overall the phone is good in this price segment. as compare to other one\\'s.!! super phone i like very much for this price 12k awesome mobile.. overall performance is excellent.. good for those people who uses cell phone for official purpose throughout the day.. multitasking mobile. you can capture a lot moments with its long lasting battery. love using insta on it.. fast loading with smoother experience. best for insta lover best mobile lenovo k8 note this price range i purchase lenovok 8 note from amazon online shopping, in this mobile lot of issue are there from begaining .i tried to contact amazon and lenovo both but did not get any satisfactory reply.issue are already mentioned in my previoue complaint.major issue are -when call comes, unable to find any name and number on screen. screen did not respon,what app or other applications are opening directly through notification pop up.mobile network is worst.mobile data also very worst.speakers are not functioning properly, left speaker not working.over heating issues,.calling issue- unable to call directly from contact number , video call issuemay more,pls,,,, i want to replace or return this mobile.\\'worst mobile ever. nice @ cool mobile hacks sometimes and google assistant doesn\\'t work properly . superb smart phone 👌 exellent average phone. little heavy in weight. good sounds clarity. heats up too much!! camera ,mobile speed , price are good received defective headset. ....charging takes more than 5 hours to get complete. .. lenovo k8 is really superb ...kundos .. very good very slow,👿👿😤 tavar problem and long charging time mobile switch offf and no response to service center picture quality is best fast charging doesn\\'t work properly,google apps suddenly has stopped working.replaced the phone after 6 days. nice “if i use phn during charging.. it takes 2 much tym to charge like 2% in 1 hour.. any 1 else who face this problem??” otherwise no heating issue.. all works well.. sometimes on jio netwrk failsand front camera is not gud.. after clicking pics got blurred.. no sharpeness the phone is quite stylish and its performance is up to notch in the category. the battery is also powerful and can withstand 1 and half days after fully charged. though turbocharging is provided you will hardly notice fast charging.though mine can charge up to 65-70% from 0% in one hour. the only problem, i am experiencing is that it does not show hotspot notifications or either detail about connected devices. also there is no support provided by lenovo as i search for it. very much excitement when unboxing this product many things are missinggreat amount of lagsno cast screencamera is goodram is not managed properlywaste of money.. worst phone i used till date . auto rotation not functioning properly it rotate any time in any direction ,and very annoying . phone switch off when charged for longer duration . only one speaker is working

previous great indian sale at discount of only ₹ 1000. now the discount is ₹ 2000. nic one product is good but it did not keep up its conditions of 10% cashback till date.. purchased a month ago... good product mobile is not as per the features there is network problems in the device, don\\'t support call recording, heating the mobile whole using, camera is not up to the mark, battery drain while using it continues.. features which already existing note k5 and k6 has are not working in k8 like cast feature. music key is also not working as per marketed.bokeh effect camera is just a gimmick to extract money from customers pocket not upto mark. camera is very very ineffective. i had k5 note it was much better device very poor phone hitting and hanging problem excellent product. meets all my expectations. superb lovable mobile,nice,super battery backup heating problem, camera quality is very poor, but thanks to amazon for refunding my money. goood buy one more there are lot of features missing in this phone. like call recording, flip to mute, smart answer etc camera is too poor using it for three months, works very well. screen casting doesn\\'t work is only drawback seen so far. battery life is good. charging is slow though. good satisfactory product in this price. sleek and stylish design. nougat experience. best feature - other slot of sd card than 2 sims. good phone signal strength is a huge pain. with airtel 4g sim the signal strength is -95 to -105 dbm (see screenshot attached) and sometimes calls drop unexpectedly. amazon is not exchanging the product, signals are pretty good on my redmi 2 and k5 note but this phone has some serious issue.i want amazon to replace this buggy device invoice nice phone been using it for approximately a month. fun to use. please read this guyslisten, i bought k8 note few days ago, and i have to return the device. don\\'t get me wrong i love lenovo devices , previously i was using k3 note(it was ok-ish), but i had to return k8 note bcz of some unusual problems.1.) though it says it has volte support, maybe it doesn\\'t and again, maybe my device was faulty. on mobile network it only shows lte (no volte) and with the battery saver on u\\'ll miss incoming calls and can\\'t even make an outgoing call(moto e4 plus also has the same problem and other lenovo devices).2.) secondly, it tends to unlock the camera interface while shooting a video, so u can\\'t tap to focus. i don\\'t know everytime i was shooting a video, it locks the whole interface, and then i had to double click and unlock it again(whole lotta work..believe me) irritating af..3.) while using jio beside the fact i wasn\\'t able to make or receive a call with battery saver on. with normal mode it was great. problem started when i started using my secondary aircel sim. after few hours the phone simply dosent detect the sim, at first i thought theres a fault in my sim, but then i used vodafone, airtel..same stuff happened.lenovo k8 note is a great device no doubt..very fast..impressive camera..average battery..but not at all optimized properly.i wish lenovo gives an ota update to fix the errors asap worst phone. battery draining very fast even n stand-by, poor camera, phone hanging lotz. it is a fine mobile at its price nice phone....long life battery best phone ion this range!i amusing this since last six months its

look like just basic android phone2) we cannot put a customized ringtones only pri loaded selected ringtones are available.3) there is no separate volume key for messages and incoming calls ringtones4)there is no separate media folder (camera photos, whats app images folder, and other social media photos folder and video folder) you have to go through file manager to find out the same which is not user friendly at all.5) there should be network speed and battery % indicator on status bar this things are also strongly missingi have just started using this phone 3 days back but yet checking the features. i will write a new review after gon familiar after few days had orderded it with the first launch on amazon.superfast and on time delivery.about mobile:very good camera.awesome battery backup.one of the best in the price range available as of now. good phone not up to expectation..and this phone has heating issue must buy. the battery was so weak and that it take 8 hours to charge to cent but you told that min 2 days of battery life but it s not cast screen not working.... i purchased it on 17th october 2017 and it is delivered today i.e on 20th october. i was using k3 note earlier. its started hanging. at first i thought not to go for lenovo but specifications temted me again to go for k8 note. it is my strong suggestion never (i repeat never) go for lenovo.in k8 note even some very basic utilities are missing. primarily noted deficiencies are.....1. call recording facility not available.2. photo gallery not available. photos open in google photo. not much secure as those are online.3. home page is very disappointing. not much flexibility available.4. there are very less options available in settings.5. led flash light is yellowish (warm white) in place of milky white (cool daylight). it appears like bulb light.6. rapid charging not working. it\\'s charging like normal charger.7. meeting/silent mode button is no where available. its important while attending meeting/conferences.a big noooo for k8 note. nice handset.... it\\'s take 6 hours for full charges so don\\'t purchase it... working fine but battery drains at faster rate while playing or surfing net. very happy with the phone....no heating issues....battery backup is gud....only disappointment is that u guys gave discount of 1000 after 20 days launch. gud good like good mobile phone not as per expectation . good, battery is good and video and audio quality is good.recently i slipped my mobile while bike ride but it has no scratches...super mobile at this price rate.-ve is i can feel lag while playing games. heat problem excellent phone poor camera quality, heating issues, fast battery draining, its slow charging only not fast charging very pathetic performance phone. very poor standard of charging and battery too. while using charger and camara mobile is heating normally and while using camara battery is draining , i give onle 3 star for battery otherwise phone is owsome gaming is very good ,it can handle any game and graphics well as per value . its hotspot can not be connected , not dual screen and not extra feature . redmi note 4 is better option. within a month time of its purchase, its display is lost paisa vasool product very nice........ love still going strong not bad only one spekar running worst product i reveived it damaged it was horrible plss dont buy this i was replaced with another mobile lenovo k8 note but even this is damaged bt i got to know tis later on usage plsssss dont buy this cheap product really very bad quality product from lenovo.very bad camera clarity.phone working slow and battery not getting fast charged. super phone, but heating when charging this is my third lenovo phone after k3 note and k4 note.worst handset ever. #lenovo #amazon #pleaselisten #lenovok8istheworstbooked in flash sale and delivered on 6th. return window was closed on 17th itself. so where is 15days return policy ?if you use any inbuilt apps , it will hang. basically with interval on 10mins it will hang.haven\\'t downloaded any extra app , except skype for business.64 gb phone with more than 44 gb free space hangs like third class phone.wanted to upgrade my phone from k4 note to k8 note . ended using k4 only after spending 14 thousands.well done amazon and lenovo....in kannada style #thoo original product by amazon the best mobile for gaming.heats up if used for a long time.battery drains a bit faster than expected but that\\'s because of the deca core processor. the charger that has been provided has started malfunctioning after 1 month. this is too annoying. it\\'s not about going to the customer service and changing it.its about time for which we resort to online shopping.but at the end of the day we had to go to the customer service to get this rectified and sorted. not good when compare to k4 note. camera not up to the mark as per specification. battery drainage in the background(almost half), headphone loudness is not enough, it is a heavy phone, audiophiles do not buy, all in all you wont be satisfied. instead go for mi a1 this phone have the worst battery life... i left my phone in 41%charge at went to bed.. at the morning it was 0%..i was scared cause it was not turning on😬😡 dolby is best feature and phone is very fast probably best phone at this price...buy it ...i will

lenovobattery backup is too badcamera is somewhat okjio sim network issuepathetic return procedure from amazonvery bad service from lenovo i did not like the lenovo k8 note there are no new features

totally disappointed from this. second camera is only a lollipop. worst phone. buy at your own risk. just loved it!! useless charging is very slow and phone is heated like iron box it\\'s camera is so good its too bad phone...because no call recording available.. cantacts saving options are directly a google drive....so much functionality missing...so dont buy it... worst production by lenovo yet.. it is having some software problem it is not resolved by the lenovo people they are very reckless about feedback on the product and battery backup is not upto the mark heating and backend programs are running no cleaning software is proved bluetooth it not working properly castle of is not possible by the given cast software nice product so so this is the worst phone i have ever used. battery is draining so fast..when i contacted service centre they that the warranty is not updated... good camera or mobile is good awesome phone with strong battery backup,loud and clear sound and many more things it\\'s very nice waste mobile in the cost, quality not up to the mark, i suggest not to buy. good product but no cast screen no sound recorder call logs and message saying last for 3 of each person lenovo help app stops by it\\'s own provide lag update of cast screen and all which customer is asking for. nice phone, worth the price😃 owsame mobile maza aa gaya use karke dear all,please dont purchase this phone as it has network connectivity issue. we may assume that my phone is one of the corner cases with defect but trust me if you visit the forum of lenovo you will see that all k8 note has network connectivity problem to the extend that we dont get any speed and lot of call drops also.google around \"lenovo k8 note, android 7.1.1- network issue\" you will get to the forum of lenovo whr everyone has reported issues and issues. you will be surprised to see that 17 pages of this issue exists which is like every next buyer has faced this.they are also not solving this problem and are sitting on it. please dont purchase this product else you are big trouble. after all if u dont get network in phone then it is a show piece :-( super fast and best camera contact not show when sending a message and phone not loaded complete apps. i have face many problem with this. hi frnds yesterday only i got my phone and this is to inform that it\\'s voice and photo quality is not good so i suggest don\\'t buy it. very good smartphone with latest features.but price fluctuating not on consumer protection. good no battery back-up no quality camera no quality sound phone is good but headfone not available in boxheadfone missing cast screen mirroring not working good best ever mobile buy it now awesome product with large screen , super battery backup and awesome performance. back camera is awesome when clicked via depth mode purchase of lenovo product is like u jump in fire. no service after sell & also no response after complain to lenovo india. i am very disappointed with this phone. completely waste of money. front camera is good but the primary one is the wrost i bought this phone from you on 25th september then due to battery issue i asked for a replacement. but still after replacement i am getting the same battery draining and charging issue. please either replace this phone or provide a refund. otherwise i have to take some further strict action. because this is not tolerable that after replacement i am getting the same issue. easy to use my lenovo k8note perched but last week big problem i got . mobile. screen will be jastlaik borne naw i will be out of mumbai i came mumbai at 13janury please how contact to com. very poor quality...20-25 min regular use after running very slow and hang apps...fast charge so bad...camera is like 7k phone...13mp. front camera like 5 mp....i think 5mp. camera is better from 13 mp. lenovo camera...mediatak deca core processor so funny sala... performance like 5k phone... i used many of android phone but lenovo k8 note my first worst experience ever. classic phone great deal. pls don\\'t buy lenovo k8 note the world worst\\'s mobile awesome features.nice mobile owsm product.don\\'t go on negative review... it is an awesome handset.. yesterday morning i got this... and it actually made my diwali special.... camera quality is good... and other features are also working cool. battery back up is also good... fast charging was also there. many more to explore... quality not best good phone with extraordinary features in budget range the mobile overall is ok due to higher specifications such ram 4 gb, internal memory 64 gb and provision for memory card and some other features, but lacks few important features that other models k4 & k5 notes have. k8 does not have power saver setting which greatly helps to save battery power when data connection is not required. it also does not have scheduled power on and off setting which also very useful to save battery power. on account of this the battery runs down very quickly\\' sound reproduction in k5 note is much better than in k8. also miss-calls and new sms are not shown on the screen icons but one has to specially click on the icons to check. difficult to know why lenovo k8 manufacturers overlooked this important features. also photos and videos cannot to be accessed directly from the camera screen but one has to access from the gallery or file manager. not satisfied with the camera and overall experience. cast screen is not being done with my smart tv like lenovo k3 note without help of google chromecast. issue this problem. this is cheating in higher version set lenovo k8 note. yeh sabse accha chalne wala mobile hai lenovo the best product nice awesome one speaker is not working n everything is ok nice mobile... but

a day.real value for money.. very good mobile. working speed is very fast. all apps are opening quickly. camera quality is also very good. battery was discharging quickly and recharging will also taking lots of time. but after new system update installed battery working is improved. now battery is full charging in 1 and half hour. and also working for whole day even after heavy use of mobile. overall best phone in this price range. not able to transfer data & apps to memory card..also, no call recording is there excessive heating and very low resale value... over heating problem a bit heavy but overall i\\'m using it for past 1month and it\\'s giving a good service.. good camera quality... very high heating problem....... you can iron ur cloths after it get heated while using fb one of worst phone. after replacement battery is not charging. nice mobile very bad network issues. frequent call drops and people keep telling me that i\\'m not reachable even when phone shows full

helped, the phone is non returnable ( just note as this thing is not there on site) only replacement is there but again its useless to buy this phone, amazon greatly dissapointed this time! lenovo k8

but battery is so bad... it takes 3 hrs and more to charge completely and just in 1hr fully gets drained..even without using..when i slept it was 81℅ and when i woke up it was 58..very bad..recommended not to buy poor quality..it is not made with gorilla glass.. charger not work properly not supported this lenovo k8 note it\\'s working only samsung mobile gd phn not up to the expectations handset is good .but service center can\\'t service well and price of charger and other parts is different in different center and very high in price. battery problem in the phone. battery draining very fast after updation to next android version..... good product. lenovo k8 note is as moto your can buy moto g5+, g5+ is better than lennovo k8 \"there is no headset\" in lennovo box heating very much when charging the most pathetic device manufactureed by lenovo .it\\'s not functioning well.not getting charged even in 5,6 hoursand that sucking policy of amazon forcing me to download that fraud app.favouring the amazon for not returning the product.trapped by amazon.don\\'t buy cellphone here. good phone nice worst phone from lenevo. lots of heating issues in device. bad rear camera quality and pathetic returning policy. awesome phone in this price. network problem phone hai volte nhi call nhi ata mat lena or heat bhi bahot hota hai quite good performance. product good but delivery so bad.iam not satisfied delivery problem in internet connection with simcamera clarity not meets expectation nice product the phone is heating up .the temperature is at back of phone is becoming too high. very worst experience with lenovo k8 note. tests should be conducted before releasing to market. good phone with some software bugs. sucks, battery drains faster than any other mobile camera is good but only about battery and charging it takes 4hours to charge i hate i can\\'t return it now i hate it screen lock problem pattern,pin, doesn\\'t appear don\\'t know why i bought 2month ago and the problem started good prodect not good. !!! charger also gone within 2 months. customer care service pathetic phone number not saved in phone nice good product. quick recharging. multiple tasking possible. good ram capacity and good camera. you can go for it nice phone and better good 8h in 30% used guys buy phone now fast this phone is disaster please don\\'t buy it today i completed 1 year of this phone and it works absolutely fine but there is only one prblm that it is written that display is covered with gorilla glass but once from my bed it gets down , and the screen cracked . not as per the xpectation...camera is not that much good !! phone is good but its rear camara is very bad in night vision...battery backup is not so good...software & display is very good the product is good fast working i ordered this diwali and come on laxmi puja most awaited for me 4gb ram, good camera quality, 10 core prosser, sounds quality dollby good... i have been using this phone since last 6 days. the pros are a) awesome screen b) big battery lasts whole day.the cons are a) worst camera of decade , because it says dual and depth all the lies b) sound is not loud , even with head phones it ia not loud, some how it is subdued. the clarity is good though. c) turbo charger is waste takes 2 hrs to full charge what is turbo about it i never understood very bad experience.with in 10 days of usage the rear camera lens collected dust in it. superb phone camera is not that good. very much disappointed by camera quality. nice product reviving again: this phone has network connectivity issue and bluetooth issue. all these days i was wondering on network and after changing sim to other phone found out issue with lenovo itself.previous review:looks good with one day use as of now. fully charged mobile will give you 24 hours battery backup with average usage.design is nice, lenovo could have reduced the bottom and top space given for camera and menu buttons. other wise it is nice, fingerprint button is at the right place for handy usage.i am adding to my previous comments - if you are looking for a great camera this is not for you! camera is not at all of good quality picture. minor heating problem is there while used continuously or during continuous gaming. charge back up is still good. completely satisfied good phone under average price product is good. initially i thought of battery issue. now it is solved and performance is overall good. killer note the battery of this phone last for 4-5 hours on time if you connect to 4g network... seriously don\\'t buy waste of money please don\\'t buy. many bugs in os and product quality is not good. i got this phone on28th may sine lost my reddi note. every thing seems to be fine with k8, but, if i compare these two; i would rate quality lenove k8 better then redmi note 8. but, content wise reshmi 4, i would rate better. k8 heats up note4 did not. i am yet to find out its call recording while calling or receiving calls in k8? well built but lacks in camera department when compared with honor 6x and also does not have a backlit keys very bad phonemobile was over heating problem please no one buy this mobile. awesome ok 13999 not worth mobile is good ...but problem with camera lenovo k 8 note fine gold good mobile phone but battery backup not good very gud camera it\\'s a worst product its ok budget phone best mobile phone is good, internet also speed connecting. i bought this phone from amazon last week. i am not a mobile phone gamer and just need the phone for normal stuff like music, emails etc. i wont review the other aspects but just want to make you aware about one particular issue that i am facing with this phone.the bluetooth on this phone does not work. it keeps disconnecting from the devices it is connected to. i have tried it with my car audio as well as jabra conference call speakers that i have. all my other phones work with them with 0 issues. this phone just doesnt work. it keeps disconnecting and reconnecting every 45 seconds or so. its really annoying and makes the phone virtually useless for me. i am forced to keep another phone in my car now and i am forced to use that phone for conference calls. why did i buy this phone, i wonder. i can understand a unit being defective, but amazon is not taking it back for an exchange. when i go to return link, it just installs a fraud perfomance measurement app which tells me that everything is fine with the phone.hey amazon, i wont become poor if you dont replace this phone, but please know that i will never again buy high value items from this site ever again if you dont get your act together and provide me with an exchange at least. best fack cornial gorilla glass it\\'s simply broken performance is ok.i used lenovo vibe k4 and k5 note. screenshot option like k4 or k5 is not available. night ke photo or depth mode ka koi matlab nhi hai. the performance of battery is very poor worst phone ever used .. second camera doesn\\'t work ..... not worth to buy worst phone... timely delivered but defective piece, volume is very very low even after having dolby speaker mode.. chutiye hai wo log jo is mobile ko 1star de k wrong review diye hai...is budget me killer mobile hai ye.. i bought it on august 2017 & still don\\'t find any fault. very nice & really a killer mobile.. very good mobile in good price.....thanks amazom lenovo phone after sales service is pathetic and quality of phone motherboards is very very cheap. my previous model of killer note series went dead just after more than a year. having spent close to 14 k one would at least expect 2/3 years lifespan. in the long run these phones may not be worth the money you spent. no options not satisfied dmg premium drop protection is not fitting for my lenovo k4 note can i return it i got what i expected i just loved this product , huge inbuilt storage, 4gb ram , the only phone with deca core processor, work really faster, high quality display & sound. light weighted. just love lenovo it seams a good device on paper but not as good which is expectedprossd card dedicated slotmedia buttongood front cam with flashgood built (not that much but good)stock android (no bloat ware )good displayfast finger print scannerconsheavy (180g)dolby atoms( not good out put the volume is very low for earphones even you can hear a person speaking loud )speaker volume (low it looks like two speakers but it has only one, another one is microphone)camera ( color reproduction is bad ,not 4k video recording ,no slow motion,fake dual camera better to use photo app to create bokeh effect,no edge detection by the camera ) can be fixed with software updatepoor ram management (if you switch between some recent apps it will reload them but still shows 2gb memory consumed (ram) )battery (poor battery life not full day with heavy usage (battery graph shows most battery consumed by os )even standby also consume battery up-to 10% , fast charging is also not that good )this is what i feel after 1 month use and still waiting for update to fix the issues hope lenovo will release update soon just like nokiai have also tried it to return after 3 days as i don\\'t feel satisfied with the product by amazon didn\\'t returned it to thing twice before you buy good product best seller happy to buy this phone don\\'t buy this phone if you want to connect your smart tv via casting ... it only support chromecast devices. so only if u are planning to buy that separately, go ahead.rest very thing is just near to perfection! nice mobile. lots of amazon products were booked using this mobile awesome easy handle, battery capacity is good, mostly sound quality is nice as it as dolby and picture quality is also good front and rear camera . excellent! not good product facing microphone issue , people in call not able to hear my voice but audible for them when speaker turned on. poor music quality mobile speaker and headphone ,dolby atomos only show offcharger cable very bad quality. bakwas pese kharab ho gye worthy product but heat fast ..and camera quality is average..not so gd..but u can use other selfie camera app for better photos..like cymerabattery drain little faster. good phone..great features.good battery life.. delivered on time.. nice mobile in this price after using the phone for approx. 15 days i am writing this review. my first opition abt the mobile is it is half cooked product with lots of issues.1) battery drain very fast and you will never get the feeling that the mobile have a 4000 mah battery. infact if you are heavy gamer or music lover than never forget to keep the powerbank with yourself.2) if you are using the jio sim than this mobile is not for you. because if you left the phone idle for more than 5 mints than the caller will get the message than the \"no is either switched off or outof coverage area\". for the other operator also network reception is very bad. and this is generalised problem. lenovo forum is already flooded with this problem and user from all over india is facing this issue.3) camera is good if you give some time.and more issues like battery drainage, slow charging etc.in my opinion dont go with mobile.there are lots of other options available with the better configuration in the same price range. hangs and heating issue after. nougat update! it\\'s a beast..camera is greatrest all spl. features are equally good every time it is taking more than 3 hours to charge from 15% to 100% in switch off and airplane mode. i think i received a defective product. i\\'m been using for 7months. on spec wise it\\'s a pretty solid one on build quality it\\'s not up to bthe mark... it says that corning gorilla i really don\\'t know what it has mean ! my display got broken with in 2months of purchase... average quality... casting will not work by default...don\\'t update oreo once you got the software update just ignore or else your feel hell on the name of killer worst phone ever, i bought it on 21 of august and after a month, it has incoming problem, i really felt bad and i want to return it and get my money back, china you fail all the time excellent phone in this segment.using from last 1 month.still searching for any drawaback but didn\\'t found. very good battery backup, good camera overall value for money nice and product was good..but i dont understand why they are not providing headphones with device?no problem at all except this. satisfied with the price n quality.true comparison with honor 6x.its better than it.i hd used both.bokeh mode is super better then 6x. phone seems to work very fast, the gui also seems to very good. something wrong with the battery drain issues, idle time only takes a lot on battery drain, though with 4000 mah, phone needs to be charged twice. charging also takes a lot of time. maybe the further software updates might fix these issues, but still these teething issues is not giving me confidence to keep this phone for long. camera is not clicking good photos during sunlight. lenovo pick up your socks on software updates gr8 cell fone in this range best mobile in this price gets overheated every day from when its recieved over heatingbattery issuecharge in 8 hours even with turbo chargerheated up even can not hold the phone in hand waste product not working properly the uk always does not respond correctly battery backup is very low pls help me to return the mobile contest winner not announced good product...and thanks amazon for

i choose, i am not able to transfer any music or pic to my phone.it gives the message \"the device has either stopped responding or has been disconnected.\"so in other words i am not able to connect the phone to the pc, whichever setting i use.please help little heating problem overall good performance k8 note is best in price range. i got this for 12000/- during diwali sale, and i am simply amazed by the performance. camera clarity, device speed, looks, display everything. i ordered it on 14 may 2018 and received on 15 may 2018. what a fast delivery by the seller. it was running on android version nought. but i updated it to oreo, latest version. running good till yet. getting warm quickly..battery performace is low over heating .... con\\'s:no proper software updates even though they mention stock android.camera not up to the mark.even amazon is not giving the good resale value even for 3 months . heating issue i want to replace this not good..i really suggest all peaople go with samsung guys....... within two months of purchase there are issues with phone charging. seems the charging point has become loose really a good phone with some small issue but with updates i think i got it best....thank you lenovo nice phone the worst brand you could ever buy. i m giging these reviews after my 3 days of usagefirst of all cheera to lenovo that finally given us stock android experience..come to point phone is very good looking, better cameras, ui interface is also good, no laggs at all till todaybut frankly speaking it disappoints in screen quality as well audio output and performancescreen quality is not as good as compare to this price range.lenovo said that phone has dolby atmos it has..but i have using lenovo vibe x3 since 1.5 years..but no phone in the world that giving that audio quality which lenovo vibe x3 hasdolby atmos not working properly in much settingsbattery drains too much fast..hope that lenovo find some soltion for this in next updatesthough it has stock android.but it cant fill us that we are using lenovo branding..my vibe x3 hasnt volte support thats why i have chose it,..in my opinion its average phone..no killer battery or killer camera. never buy this product, they have reduced price in just span of 45days after 1st sale. you can consider how worst phone is. to amazon/lenovo -> as we fellows are fools, how can you decrease price after 45days of launch which we purchased at full mrp rate. bad experience phone screen quality yellowliesh.... i think that the battery life is some what less after usedfor some time camera quality and video quality is very poor.. best phone in it\\'s range. that\\'s awsm not working excellent product.. best deal in this price... go on with this.. gets heated fast, cam so so, battery is not up to mark and won\\'t last as specified. drains fast. won\\'t last all the day. regarding sound ring tone is ok. it is very loud at 71% of the volume as set by the manufacturer. but while talking it is not good enough. even at 100% of the volume, it is not clear and not good enough to hear. battery won\\'t last even 8 hours with less talking. even it won\\'t charge fully even after more than 10hours of charging. camera quality is not at all good. very blurry pictures. waste of moneydon\\'t buy it. never buy it. don\\'t waste your money. spend on good phones even though they are a bit costly. both cameras are with high quality..... lenovo is a worst phone brand... got fed up with continuous hanging... camera is poor... overall performance not good enough... worthless piece... good product from lenovo product is very good. bad show by lenevo again,specifications are good in papersnot in physicalpoor rear camera, worst phone apps always keep stopping worst user interference camara is not good too it is better to buy mi a1 than this phone restarts itself crash it\\'s self wast phone lot of tons of problems in this phone worst smartphone i have ever purchased worst battery life serious charging issues battery drain within 2 hours and charging time takes 4 hour it is not better redmi note 4 better buy redmi note 4 and note 4 have better battery life and better performance and no heating issues everything is fine except a bit heating issue but it can be solved after switching on the battery saver. awesome phone..... recommended this phone very nice excellent product .. fully satisfied..dealer should send a tuffon glass too..it would be liks cherry on cake.. mobile is good but battery life is not good and camera medium best hardware wise quite good.but software in not customisable.use as lenovo/google wantsnot as u want... many basic functions are not provided.battery heats up little.photo quality is good.depth mode is so so. got in good condition from amazonproducts also excellenttop processor currently in marketexcellent microsoft featureall updated features can\\'t cast the phone to the television bhot hi bekaar mobile hai ye 4 gb ram hone ke baad bhi itna hang hota hai good phoneper iski speaker accha nhi hkuch purane note mobile vali setting nhi h ultimate design & clear picture quality....no heating issue..... & best android phone in this budget.... thanks to lenovo team for a great product...... good mobile... features are excellent.. worth for money.. amazing phone. i would rate it 5 stars if earphones were included in the box. 1 thing it has 4000 mah battery but it don\\'t give battery backup as i expected on the basic of it\\'s review2 this phone not keep long life battery backup as like you said 376 hours it contain only 26- 30 hours onlyit seems like local phone not equipped with design and internal design using for 9 months, excellent phone and superb quality and great features like 4gb and 64gb and 2.3ghz and dual rear camera and selfie 13 mp ...overall i can say it\\'s an outstanding mobile good great experience with amazon.... delivery before time....lenovo k8 note is very nice product...value for money with respect to specifications available.. good mobile good working very much weighted.. earphone not working properly. company said 3.5mm jack earphone but when we use earphone it is not plugged .the wire is not fitted .plz suggest me what to do..... personally product is awesome but when we talk about amazon return policy, it\\'s not so helpful for customers from technical support team. good looking , smooth response, good sound via headphones jack ,fast charging work good nice awesome i like this model thanks to lenovo no headphone is working i dont like it not meeting expectation with reality. worst phone. phone might have loads of features camera sound processor, but is off no use if phone does not have power to run this application. battery even in standby mode without data on, only 10 calls are getting exhausted, need to on the battery booster, it\\'s really pathetic after doing rigorous market research end up buying a good phone with battery having worst life ever.reason being given five star, wanted to noticed who has decided to buy this phone and reading good reviews with good rating. pls do not buy, although it is cheaper than industry standard, but even 1000 rs don\\'t want to spend if it is not value for money 1. battery draining very fast.2. charging takes 7-8 hours for full charge.3. heating too much. pls don\\'t buy this mobile.becoz video resolution is worst.charging time also more than two hours.camera quality also worst.pls pls don\\'t buy.i think nokia mobile is best excellent average phone battery backup is very poor.....getting hot very fast.not satisfied results.it\\'s a 3rd class product.....i got no support from customer care. nice handset in a price range good but battery not good as expected....and most wanted problem is network problem specially network of jio is very poor waste of money very good phone under the budget.. not bad heats up faster.camera clarity is not worth of 13mp. very bad, camera quality is worst. battery draining in hours... heating while using and charging.. contacted amazon for return. they directly refused to return just asking for replacement.. so product is bad but the amazon service and support is worst. i request amazon cs managers to come to me and have some lesson on how to assist customers and teach the same to leads, sups and reps. ye froud company hai, product kharab hone ki complain during time karne ke bad bolte hai problem sove karenge ,aur fir time nikal dete hai aur bolte hai complain ka time nikal gaya ,fir call karne par koi call nahi uthata.this is very bad company.... after k4note, actually downgraded the version but named it a new one, why?it\\'s nice but not better than k4note great product battery backup is not good. software need improvement. good phone, missing call recording during call, lenovo shuold provide update of this all over performance is gud , processing is so fast u can install apps in seconds the only problem is battery.battery disappointed me a lot a great buy in genuine price, amazon made it easy. i was nice it\\'s good,like really awesome nice phone not good products and very heating problem face in this device because of heating display 10% blank so i\\'m suggestions all of you please don\\'t purchase this product and service center demond 6500 rupees for change new display bad phone as expected...but battery power is less. ... drained up quickly very poor nice mobile awesome product from lenovo. nice mobile camera quality is very good.....aal feature is very nice it\\'s the very best amongst the phones that i have used mobile is awesome, but battery backup is not good..camera is fantastic nice bought this in the great indian festival. its been a week and i am pretty satisfied. highlights:1. battery backup is great- the ota update might have fixed the bug or people were wrong.2. no heating in general use. however, if you open some heavy apps you might see some warmth.3. the front camera is world class, while the rear camera isn\\'t upto my expectation to be honest.so all in all a great phone, every phone would have some cons and same is for this as well. but 4 stars are quite apt. positive;:designsoftwarestoragemusic keydolby atmosvr experiencefinger print sensorgoogle assistantdedicated sim and storage slotscons:weightpoor indoor camera

phone as killer note, it is honestly a killer one. today, i\\'m posting my reviews. i\\'m using this phone from last one week. there are some pros and some cons too..good ones :-deca core processor,slim and sleek design,powerful and quick response,lighting fast fingerprint sensor,feather touch,brighter display,feels classy,brilliant front camera,no heating problem,no lagging or hang problem...areas of disappointment :-1. rear camera - it was not as good as to be. there is some lack of stability and photo quality is not up to the mark.2. battery life - though it is 4000 mah but it didn\\'t last for a day. as this is my new phone but battery drains within a day.3. screen quality - previously i was using samsung note 3, so might be a bit biased but as per k8\\'s screen resolution, this problem should not come. thought screen is bright enough but it shows some unexpected errors or lack of smoothness was observed while playing videos.4. earphones - this is a very awkward. cheap cost cutting techniques. i was very surprised when i didn\\'t found earphone in the box. this is really unexpected. so that i remove one star out of five.5. packing quality - packing quality from amazon was very poor. phone was packed in just a piece of cardboard only. no bubblesheet, no protection against water damage, handling damage.so that, 3 out of 5 stars.this is all,but i must say if you want a powerful and stylish phone within the budget, you must go for it. good fairly good awesome product....killing processor....nice performance but camera is average in low light...shutter speed is also not to the expectation... totally this mobile is awsme, front came jst ok, perfomance wise good, phone is good but delivery was late no earphones on this mobile turbo charging is not working properly and camera has minor cons but overall product is good camera performance no android version not expanded me a good smartphone under 15000 rs. best prossecer, awesome camera, front flash is good for selfies,dollby speakers are unbeatable,long time battery life all over a nice smartphone.only heating issue is a negative point. battery backup is very badbad performance:- heating issue ,batter issue ,camera problem ,network catches very low strength. mobile is very very good but too heating problem & charge lasting problem... i think battery is not good... there are two rear camera but one of them is not working. pathetic experience with lenovo k8 note.1. cast is not working.2. second sim slot is only for 3g, instead of 4g as described.3. call recording option is missing.lenovo is making fool of it\\'s customers. a good phone from lenovobuilt quality - okuser friendly - yesbattery life - greatcamera - good( nice selfie phone)i used this for video vlogingsome times it get power off it self phone build quality is good but slightly heavy.lenovo always have back finger print scanner which works well even though expecting for a front finger print.battery back up is ok. which gives 9 hrs with continuous screen on time. excellent this is worst phone do not buy this phone.. both amazon and lenovo is cheating with us. each and every feature is worst.. please read the full review here.this phone is one big mess, it hardly manages 6 hours of screen on time.forget about lasting a full day.i got a maximum of 6 hours of sot and a minimum of 4 hours 30 minutes on a single charge.i\\'m a light to medium user.i use 3g with 2 hours of mobile data and 4-5 hours of wifi.if you are thinking you can make a day with the phone you are wrong.please do not make this mistake and don\\'t go for positive reviews. if the phone has been really positive it had a score of 4 or more, and not many people have reviewed this phone.the camera quality is ok ok, with the depth effect still to be enhanced.performance is awesome but battery life really killed the phone. 4000 mah battery doesn\\'t seem to help at all.redmi note 4 gives better battery performance of 8 to 9 hours of sot with exactly similar performance.i don\\'t think you should expect software updates and hope things will get better in the future, that is how lenovo works.release stupid phone and make money from stupid peoples like us.but if you still wanna buy god help you. i have not received earphone with the phone. not good battery backup nil camera is very worst in mobile.image quality is very different than original look. for example i have captured picture of pink shirt and its looks like purple shirts in image. front camera have same problem as mentioned for rear camera. photo and video quality is very bad in mobile.there is no use of camera in mobile.sound quality is also not good compare other mobile. it sound like china and cheap mobile.memory,processor and ram are only good feature in phone.my advice is not to buy this phone. it is worth spend money on this mobile. poor performance product is good, but battery service is not so good. heating issue good one this phone not volte turbocharging is not working properly after 6 months.... battery discharged very fast. bluetooth not connecting to my lenovo smart watch properly. it\\'s connected some times and some times not. in call other side person voice is very low. over all not at all good. this model not suggestabul. better to don\\'t buy. mobile heats a lot.....battery back up worse i\\'ve ever seen.....camera below average.......other things are good....i don\\'t think it\\'s worth the money. nice product acha nhi h bahut aachha hai sir nice product very nice and amazing and the product was very fast in using and but heating issue is there #camera 5/10# battery little bit doubt isn\\'t 4000mah# processor 8/10# looking gudfinally camera quality poor nice phone good looking excellent don\\'t think just go for it 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 screen mirroring and wifi connectivity is very essential now a days having a big snart tv and not able to cast to the screen really fedup with this mobile. unfortunately no website is highlighted . connevtity is your concern do not buy this mobile. i have given only two stars cz the video quality sucks...i regret buying this cell.. primary cam is good..but whenever u wanna do video the clarity sucks very badly.. i\\'m really disappointed..after going through many many reviews i bought this.. worst, amazon\\'s quality getting worst. got phone with camera fault verry nice product value for money phone... i bought it 11990.. worst productmobile battery draining fast even though update the mobile from service centeralso mobile heats up in normal use this is not update version 8.0 oreo pls don\\'t trust on amazon.... i had booked lenovo k8 note ... i got damage phone after 2 days i had to faced so many problem like overheating , camera are working or touch key are also working .after that they suggested me visit on lenovo service center .... i did all process as these guys . i had visited over there 5 times. now they asked me we can \\'t help and cut my call with rudeness..... pls don\\'t buy any product from amazon ....if any one need any prof . i had all mail and all call recording . my phone is only box for me within 15 days .and no one taking responsibility for this either lenovo and amazon. i had waste my money and after had waste my time for misguide suggestions... i like everything about this phone, good sound quality, good picture quality. value for money package i got my lenovo k8 note 16 sep today 18 only two and i\\'m facing problem... am happy with most of its features.however the much touted \"rapid charging\", through its turbo charger does not happen at all. it takes about 5 hours for a full charge. this is extremely slow. is anyone else facing this problem? i cannot find 15w charging written anywhere on my charger. what is this problem? lenovo engineers wake up and do something... not good phone awesome like i reveived the phone but back cover is seems like used one. it got scratches and phone box is also seems used. headseat and sim ejuct pin not available good handset .. speaker problem in few days & in dual cameras 5mp camera does not work & battery backup not good compare to redmi note 4 an excellent device, very premium look and feel. camera quality best at this level (i rate only the cool1 above this). lots of space (4gb/64gb) and no lag issues. haven\\'t done extreme gaming but otherwise it exceeds expectations for business/personal functions.untweaked android allows you to customise apps that you are already used to.. sound quality is by far the best in similarly priced phones.only con for me right now is the longish boot time .all in all, highly recommend. product is really good worth for rs 13000 and battery is also powerfull with one day usage with all the features .overall a nice product from line from lenovo .thanking your.kumaresan best smartphone at this budget very nice and exactly fitting for lenovo k8 mobile. it is not worth. it is not like lenovo note5. with experience of note 5, k8 is even lower than note 5. very bad experience. the contact gets lost. the saved nos. gets lost. don\\'t waste money. too much heating issue excellent product. thanx lenovo, thanx amazon very nice phone in this budget segment. 2.3ghz processor very good speed & 3g & 4g connectivity, fantastic camera & fingerprint sensor response will never annoyed. battery backup is make it very much comfortable. loss of money..worst phone ..bcz worst battery backup...batteey not supported particular 1 day without use..i feel that i m using 2000mah battery phone.. selfie camera not up to 13 mp expectations,both camera depth and richness is like 2 mp camera in low lighting condition,delivery is great in time awesome phone 📱 overall its a good phone, only disappointment for me is with camera, camera was not upto mark both front and back, dual camera also not working proper with depth sense.i am expecting some improvements in coming updates. the cast feature doesn\\'t work. no devices are found. it wont even search for devices. the vr function is out of sync. it doesn\\'t support. they boast in their launch event that its a \"theatre max\". they didnt even properly checked whether the vr basic videos can be played in it. what a disgrace. the images are out of sync and shows as 2 images during watching. the sound effect is pretty good and performance and battery is good. but, the vr and cast bugs are the worst possible reasons to hate it. screen bakvas he.. overall phone is ok.time shown wrong on home screen.battery backup is too good.rest all r ok.best phone. very nice phone good product..... good product in this rate.good service amazon . received in good condition excellent its very good product. not bad phone speed and efficiency is good. gaming is also good. but the major drawback is that phone heats up pretty bad when charging,gaming and when online, everything else is a beautiful craft. battery drains a bit faster than expected. the phone arrived the next day i ordered, so service is good too. display is good. revising my earlier review written about 4 months ago in which i gave 5 stars.the biggest problem is battery, which is getting worse with each system update. its 4000 mah battery is worse than a contemporary similar phone with 3000 mah battery. something seriously wrong and the irony is no serious effort by lenovo to rectify it. barely after 4 months of the purchase, i have to recharge the phone twice every day. it now seems the problem is beyond redemption.secondly, i am not able to send the image from photos to a folder (on selecting the image), without being online. nice smart phone. it is with great build quality and high end performance gazab mobile h camera faddu and hang to hota hi nhiii bilkul bdiya phone h 💯 yes, amazon service & promise both are excellent. mobile was awesome.. packings are good.. and same product i got .. thank you amazon not at all good product1. 4000 mah battery doesnt last long even for 24 hrs2. it takes 4 hrs to charge 100%3. phone\\'s temperature raises as high as 40° c even in normal use like whatsapp4. depth mode (dual cam) is not working properly5. hotspot is not working6. this time amazon is pathetic, not at all helpful. you can not return the product. first you need to speak to technician about you phone and then they will run test and only if test fails then they will place a replacement request. that too you need to followup with them for the pickup, they don\\'t come. after replacement if your replaced phone is having some issue (issue will be finalized by them) then only they will place an order for refund. less features than lenovo vibebad experience awesome phne..but one lacking in this phone..there is no notification or indication light for what\\'s app msg received like miss call, text msgs or gmail phone is good..but i didn\\'t get a bill,so pls can u send me a bill of this mobilee mail:-sk.hasan78696@gmail.com not satisfied. camera is very bad sahi krao yr isse lenovo walo dont expect much from this perfect smart phone for price below 15k. matches with many costly smart phones. happy dont buy , start software issue from 2 nd day . had returned good product but earphone is missing. worst mobile ...pls don\\'t buy it guys i\\'m using this for 20 days .. battery s very poor it\\'s not enough for 1 day..dual cam for name sake oly it\\'s have dual cam but single came oly working ....i had update the phone after 5 daysfirst 5 days battery was good after update it become worst ...lenovo s not updating it\\'s bug quickly ... it\\'s paste update s on september 5 ... til now no update main issue suddenly hanging, switching off repeatedly.touch screen is not working properly & it gets hot like iron box while charging and after wifi usage of 15 min constantly. good mobile video playing is not goodturbo charger is not proper working compared to other phones, for this value it is very good one.the processor is very good.no heating problem.ram is good.memory is good.battery is good.camera is good.it is very slim.good clarity.looking very nice.one important feature cast with smart tv is not working.the phone updated in an authorised lenovo service center,the cast screen problem is not solved right now.when connecting bluetooth audio in my car the sound is not clear.these two big problems continuing.both are advanced features and is not working .in my old k3 note both features working fine.so please take necessary action to solve the issue otherwise it is a cheating of customers.. so far it was nice experience wid wonderful bus \"amazon.in\" waste phone it is heating home and sound is not loud blur is not working correctly good phone it has a solid build. design is also good.no issues with camera .but phone heats a lot while charging.also the battery takes a lot of time to charge and drains a lot. the most worst product bcoz there is not supporting of 4g or lte .the jio card is also unsupported . don\\'t buy i just want to send back this product it is hangout too all best options, net speed good, but one main problem single speaker, no stereo sound, awesome product with a speedy delivery worst phone.. please don\\'t buy after use 15, this is waste of money, dual camera is just show piece. heating up issue & major problem is not charging. amazon is a cheating with costumer show 10 days replacement & refund but actually is not. very good bekar item i can\\'t install or delete any applications because mobile reboots when install or uninstall any application. it reboots min 10 times to install/uninstall any apps. the same issue for os update. amazon cheated by giving defective product. its worth to give even 1 star but no way to give 0 start. i wan\\'t replacement. not refund. i got this phone on 4th sep now it is not working product is not good.it is very heating problem.i suggest all of us it product not buy. just waste of your valuable time performance is good.also camera quality is good.front camera is better than rear camera. battery quality is medium phone is aweome....under 11k good phone i got it under discount of 2000 cons:-1. heating issue2. battery drain quickly3. hotspot issue4. rear camera is not good worst product i ever got.after updating to oreo phone restart again and again. i went to service centre for three times and even they don\\'t have any solution for it he told me to wait for an update again and then only the problem can be solved so by having no other option i need to exchange that mobile for just 3000 rupees goooooood bluetooth headset has some trouble in it. remaining superb overall its performance is so good it is a useless product. once the sims are inserted, the tray is stuck up. sims cannot be retrieved. i think the charger is not a turbochargerapart from slow charging everything is fine with the phoneeven the phone is capable of playing 4k videossnipper 5 mp camera at back is not working properly nice one the phone is goood.....light weight 13mp selfie cam with a 14cm big wide screen.games work well and the sound quality is awesommmmme. disgusting product purchased..it\\'s bluetooth connectivity is not good also mobile is not working as hotspot. there no volte option lenovo the worst in that phone quality seems good till now. many people don\\'t know so wanted to tell here that turbo charger charges your phone from 0-50% in 30 mins and than rest of the charging is normal.the delivery was done 2 days late by amazon which spoiled all my plans. rest all seems good with phone at this price tag. after three months. it\\'s not charging.its slow started using this phone a week back..just used phone for calls,phone is getting heated up very badly, battery is charging very very slowly..and to my surprise i am not able to connect it to laptop or desktop..it is not getting recognized.got this phone for battery backup.

box.kindly arrange to exchange with complete accessories asap. returned! bluetooth speakers face lot of interuption when songs are played, while mobile data(4g) is on, even if songs are played from sd

readable this mobile not supported the jio sim so plz help me what i can do now its been 4 months and though the product is getting a bit slower to use even though i have not filled it up with space

but the phone is slow. battery is draining down quickly i need to return this what should i do nice phone but not very good phone excellent product it will reach our expectations , great camera clearity have duty metal unibody , looks sexy performance very good as new battery back up for 18 hours and havy use it can be done full day fast charging is superb it changed full charge within 2 hours from 0 ,don\\'t take tension just buy itthanks great product and delivery... unhappy with amazon fake promotional offer , marketing schemes and dual beahaviour in customer handlingpros:1. turbo charging2. touch is scratch resistancecons:1. you will not get a headphone in the package.2. amazon promised to give motorola sports headphone in rs: 699/- but at the time of purchase i was unable to get one. later amazon denied this offer.3. phone is bulky.4. dual camera functionality is hidden and not ui friendly.5. speaker\\'s sound is noisy.6. battery discharge faster than expected7. both sim not running 4g at a time very good looking phone while seeing feature-wise, but there are many worst things compared to previous lenovo phones.1. the keys at the bottom i.e. back key and shortcut key are reversed as they were in k4 or k6 etc. very foolish. how does an existing lenovo user can upgrade to this phone. even all other qualities are good, the basic operation of mobile is very difficult. the back key must be on right side for easy and one hand operation.2. these keys must be led. otherwise it is difficult to find them in darkness. and on gold colour phone it is very difficult to find them.3. there are no stereo speakers ( one at top and other at bottom ). then why have to boast about dolby atmos. with ear phones there will not be much difference whether dolby atmos is on or off. in k4 note the stereo speakers are the best. i am using it from 8 months. very good 3d sound . but you can\\'t get from k8 note.4. in addition to play button on side, additional 2 buttons previous and next are to be provided. then this will be an excellent music phone....\"oh god, please gift us k9 note with all specs as of k8 note and speakers as in k4 note with back key on right side\".. . . d. goury manohar reddy battery backup is to low....!!!there is no heating issue while using bt heats too much during during charging....!!!!!some time touch doesnt work properly..very disappinting....after spendin14thousand i received only garbage nad nothing else... very nice front camera...lovely sound qha5 this is very good smartphone nice phone.. battery backup is excellent..touch is very smooth.camera quality is ok.speaker sound is amazing..phone is bit heavy in weight...gallery is missing( using google photos app). very good product my phone has been damage on 27 september screen damage on one shot.i request u to change my phone. not worth the money. my phone battery is dead, it\\'s just nine months since i bought it in september 2017. good product with excellent features good ohone best future mobile everage handset good mobile ,use it then you can justify. not good heating issue starts from first day.. product is good no doubt, it\\'s build quality is great,and i always love dolby atmos in lenovo sets ,i always wonders why other brands don\\'t give this feature, but again i disappoint by packaging from amazon,they leave to wraps specially electronic items in bubble wraps,which i asked for many time and evertime they ignores ,i really don\\'t like this good smartphone just malfunctioning best handset in dual camera mobiles it is the best phone battery charging is very very slow. and drained from 100% to 10% with in two hrs. hearing problem, it\\'s very fantastic one.. i got a new one for my whole expectations... thank you amazon.. a real killer. basic bluetooth function does not work. buyers, google for \"lenovo k8 note bluetooth\" and you will find lot of complaints on lenovo forums. they have still not managed to reslolve it. it does not connect to my garmin. nor does it connect to car stereo. connection breaks off frequently. i do not even have the option of returning it.my second disappointment with lenovo in 6 months. never again!does not even have ant+ which i though would be a basic feature it would manage to carry.i am not someone to spread negative reviews and this is the first time that i am so disappointed with a product that i have to post a negative review (i always used to think that those who post negative reviews are paid off by competitors but thanks lenovo, i now trust all naysayers !) nice phone, but some features are missing. like call recording, screen casting, connecting to p.c., message tone, etc. it\\'s a nice phone to use and nice brand.... m happy to buy it good battery backup and a high performance processor which keeps you in top speed configuration is good but handset get heated quickly and 4000mh battery doesn\\'t provide 50% performance of said capacity, it doesn\\'t provide backup for full day and need to charge twice a day in morning and in evening to keep running handset. i guess this phone is good but wherever amazon delivers are defective pieces.. please don\\'t buy this phone here.. attractive product. neeed invoice.. kindly mail it to ac.khuzema@gmail.com good one battery is getting drained faster. my jio sim is not working without internet connection. services centres are very less. nobody help me. battery is the claimed 4000 mah it performs less than 3000 mah. i am completely fed up and i wasted a lot of time and money i am going to return it. very bad mobile phone ,😔😔 using for more than a year still running good... no issues till now one of the best buys i have done. the only thing is the battery life. wish the battery lasted a bit longer. battery lasts 24 hours with extensive data usage. i am not much of a gamer.. but the speed is super awesome. features are brilliant, stock android is great. don\\'t buy as phone doesn\\'t ring after 10 minutes of screen off super phone cool very poor very nice device and running so smuthly.and amezing camera network & hotspot signal bad cast sensor missing perfect phone for regular use super mobile camera super, battery backup very nice, full charge 1.5 hours.no hanging heating problem.... its back side getting hot automatically many times.. . it\\'s worth for the price. network problem he baaki nice at the it has heating and battery drainage problem.i got a replacement but same problem repeats and mobile switched off .i get refund . whaste of money led notification is not working, over heating while charging and use. no sim number is system tray. finally gone dead within two days. it does not on. need to return the device for refund. excellent first camera not working few problems i am facing with this phone- battery drains too fast.- lags in audio output in bluetooth devices such as speakers and headphones.- no option to turn on miracast or screen mirroring.- network issues.- camera is not that great. average camera with worst ever bookeh effect.lenovo should fix this issue in next update otherwise it will lose another customer.customers are not the priority for lenovo that is for sure.lenovo please take care of this issue. do not make rubbish.after oreo update it is getting worse.functionality of phone getting worse.headphones not working. battery is getting discharged so easilyheating up issues while charging as well as when not in use with with 20 to 30% discharge.this is for you lenovo please release update to fix these issues. mst phone camera results v gudlittle heating problemturbo charger not working good take 3 hrs to full charge the phone is nice and camera quality is quite good but the bokeh mode is just fine overall the phone is good. but in just 15 days i found a problem with the proximity sensor. the screen would get activated while talking and gps etc. would get activated. also, while playing games the display brightness fluctuates. now it\\'s too late to return the phone :(update 20/06/2018--------------------------it\\'s just about 6 months, so thought of sharing an update. the specs of this phone are very impressive and i loved using the phone. but that\\'s about it. here are the problems i faced:1) proximity sensor defective. the phone screen would sometimes not switch off and gps, airplane mode etc. would get activated accidentally while talking2) bluetooth connectivity is horrible.sometimes the sound would completely get broken up making it impossible to use it with bluetooth headphones3) while typing a message random characters would automatically get typed, and even after deleting them some more would again appear. had to quit the application and try again.my earlier phone was a lenovo k4 note and within 3 months the screen started getting a yellow smudge on one side, then started the problem with random characters getting typed. that phone didn\\'t last a year. seeing the impressive specs i again went for lenovo k8 note. bad mistake!.unless lenovo gets their quality issues sorted out they are in for a tough time ahead. i have had enough of lenovo phones. sold my phone within 6 months. turbo charging has no sense in it. lenovo provided 3a charger with turbo charging. it takes 2 hours to full charge from 0% to 100% if i doing nothing. heating very much. frequently close many apps. some reviewss says that it charge 40% in 20 minutes is totally wrong as i am experiencing. as camera and battery just average, this phone is below the average phone. its cost should have been under 10k. nice product ! but battery drain fast hey i am buying this product today... in the boxes handset,usb cable, & one pice 15w charger... 2 pice charger not found in the box... chor hai sala... super phone only 1 charger received instead of 2. phone features is good but it\\'s battery performance is very poor. 13999 rupees is too many for this phn. great offer...and a even more greater delivery....just took a day!!!!...very contended after the purchase initially 3 days it was working very good.. but started facing issues major on network range. unable to connect internet as well as calls. was thinking problem with sim. ultimately found problem in mobile. frnds plz do read the reviews then place the order. i have placed order in the first day itself. felt so pathetic all d tym while using it nice phone ghatiya phone hai, screen resolution ekdam bakwas hai, main lekar pachta raha hoon, koi mat kharidna, paise ki barbadi hai ye phone, customer support bhi thik see kaam nahi karta hai sab field bharne ke baad bhi fail to create ho raha hai. good product received two day\\'s back, 1st impression, wow looks great. dual camera could not find any difference, my lenovo k4 note shoots better.over all it\\'s okay, but but but, battery drains out very fast,4000 may is all fluke, that too without any whatsapp or face book or my office mail client installed. heavier more than my k4.lenovo is good but k8 mmmm, let\\'s see, it\\'s only two days. mast hai bhai. le le hangs 15-20 times a day. ready worst phone i have used ever.plz return the phone if possible. superb mobile. fast charge and processor is very good. camera clarity is awesome this is best phone i had lenovo k4note and that\\'s why i upgraded to lenovo k8 note. its a nice mobile but mine was having so many issues that screen mirroring not working, flash light not working, front camera not working etc, so returned it immediately. lost hope on lenovo now. front side gold finish not good. but mobile super, camera average. lenovo k8 notegood mobile in budget.4gb ram 64 gb storagedual camera with flash on both front &back.turbo charger giving a low time for charging. average display disign writing

software features are missing like1. the option for scheduled power on/off is not there.2. the option for customised ringtone is not there.3. the option for hotspot metering like in lenovo k3 note is not there. i was using lenovo k3 note before. i bought this phone with great expectations, but it is not at all up to the mark.1) camera quality is very poor2) heating issue, the phone heats even after 5 mins of using camera and charging3) battery drains very fast, even when the phone is idle.4) whatsapp and mail led notification not working5) display video and camera sharpness is not good over sharp6) microphone is not working properlyonly ***** 5 star given for amazon,, delivery fast,,service excellent,,and customer support is brilliant unhappy for this product good heating problem so dont buy lenovo mobiles battery backup is very bad. dual camera is a joke in this phone. overheating problem. not a killer smartphone. much better phones like lenovo p2 and redmi note 4 that mobile phone feature is awesome but u perform any task the phone heating like as charging , tethering open and using more time. rest of the phone is awesome. battery performance is low and phone is getting heat quickly awesome mobile phone very good good product build quality, multi tasking is good. camera quality is not up to mark and phone heats too much while using camera. secondary camera is just gimmick nothing to do with. audio while listening through good quality head phone is very good and event external speakers are loud enough. overall good product from lenovo with minor flaws like over heating while camera use. battery back up getting 1.5 days with moderate use. if you use heavily then only one day you will get. as oreo update is promised with google security peaches on time and a clean google operating system without bloatware you can live with this well built phone. not recommended for those who looking for phone with good camera. replacement paisa wasool ....dual cam isn\\'t fill expectation i am using this phone before three month .but problem in this phone is so heat when you using charging time is very very long....about 7 hour...esme turbo charger h fir bhi changing hone ma about 6-8 hour leta h.....i think that\\'s not good mob.... product is combination of moto and lenevo interface is good not hanging sooo the phone is amazing. i have been using lenovo from the beginning of a7000 models and it has got a unique style in each model. recommended for the price and quality. battery backup is so poor. very nice good product delivery is good ,mobile is not as perfect as it is described on the website cast screen option available but it didn\\'t work out .all other android device have this option even much chiefer handset than k8, also turbocharger didn\\'t

to any wireless display. k8 note connects to only chrome cast. k8 note smartphone is not as smart as smart tv\\'s are, because k8 can\\'t connect to your smart tv. this is real killar amazing phone with brilliant specs, working perfectly fine :) nice ... it\\'s good phone everything in just half price.with these features and this quality of product it should be double it\\'s price.i\\'ve been

how to replace the phone. good mobile. battery backup also very good. good phone there are many technical issues like wifi disconnects and reconnects only when rebooted, mobile heats a lot, device lags a bit, battery performance was worst.so i returned it. this lenova k8 note mobile is quickly hot in back side mobile we bought lenovo k8 note mobile, a handset with box should match 2 piece 15w turbo charger and usb cable, but after opening the box i found a handset, 1 piece 15w turbo charger and usb cable, when will my 1 piece 15w turbo charger and usb cable get this is advertised with mobile whats in the box handset, 2 piece 15w turbo charger and usb cable isme bhut sa app nhi chalta he battery backup is not good very cheap product.pls don\\'t buy this product good value for money nice product value for money. instead of stock android they could have add some user need features like finger print access to calls, app, scheduled on and off etc. nice it isvery good to my budget range by looks and usage its a better deal, but while considering day to day apps we needed, this mobile lacks much...we cant always download apps frm playstore and get to see the ads for which we using.have to work on depth mode differentiating the layrs and capturing by distance...it lags, blurs everywhere.dolby is jus a app, no audio improvemnts, i find lenovo k4 note better than this k8 note nice phone. we are enjoying. camera is too good. sound is awesome. ram is faster.. problem in network and phone was over heating finaly totay phone is pick up by amazon rep. for replacement what could be better just it should have been 4k i have checked rear camra but only single camra it has i haveput finger on upper camra and open camra then change in depth mode for secend camra but no change so i want tell u all please check and confirm it\\'s have single rear camera that\\'s i have checked in my phone both time down side camera is clicking picture worth product at a good price!! worst mobile battery back up not so good it running down soon and heating on fone call. super it\\'s a worst mobile i have seen ever. after getting its hanging and battery also not charging fast camera is so good but battery life is not with the given features this phone is just about ok.it feels good in the hand, sturdy and body.but thats where it ends.1. the phone ringer is pretty low - you cannot hear the phone in a different room, even if it is at full volume.2. there is some issue with the firmware, because of which alarms keep getting missed regularly (even with 3rd party apps).3. after 6 months, it has become slow.4. for some reason, any gallery app i use, cannot access the sd card - tried several things, but does not work.5. most importantly - the data network goes on an off intermittently and is extremely slow. after showing to the lenovo care store, they kept it for 5 days and then asked me to take it back since they were yet not able to figure out the issue.better products are available in the market. don\\'t go for this one. very bad phone awesome!! phone is heating up and hangs ..it doesn\\'t look like deca core..plz don\\'t buy it..i just bought it for my dad. even lite users like him can\\'t use it .. nice phone very bad product by lenovo, hanging problem with 4 gb ram. so silly product. automatically keys are working. awesome phone how many speakers have this phone?my phone was one speaker working it\\'s a very nice product which will fulfill all requirements that someone wishes in his/her mobile. unique product. i\\'ll recommend my dear and near folks to buy it. a lot of areas of improvisation at that price. sound quality is bad...atmos does exhibit full capacity. call management console is not user-friendly. purchased on middle of november... by february suddenly stop working, charging was not happening given to servicing.. waiting for the phone for the last four days ...i heard that this is common with lenovo phones..this was my first post...please see whats happened later on...my self dr. prajith, writing from veraval, gujarat. i have purchased lenovok8 note k8 through online (amzone) on 16th october 2017. in the month of february 2018, suddenly one day the phone showed malfunctioning. the charging was not happening , but the charger symbol was on. i have approached nearby mobile mechanic he advised me to sent lenovo centere. in vereval there was no centre for lenovo. so he himself took the responsibility and sent for servicing with original bill. after the waiting of 10-15 days, i got my mobile back.all the data and contacts were lost and he informed that the it was a software problem. (i paid some amount to the fellow as some handling charge) but still the problem with charging was not was rectified. the charging was happening only of kept in some particular position. now suddenly again my phone got dead. it is less than 6 month after purchase. bought this for my brother, he loves it and it is actually the best phone with the features offered vs price. lenovo / motorola doing justice to this price segment. love the phone, go for it. battery backup-1-1.5 days with lot of fb and online activity but no gamesusp- split screen(vr) mode no app required(theater mode not 3d)problem- heating and signal reception is just very very badupdate after 2.5 months of usage--> battery backup started going down though usage has actually reduced, also now it takes more time to charge to 100%. i expected battery issues with andriod but not so early. don\\'t think & just go for it... lenovo\\'s one of the best mobile. every department is simply fine i want to buy 2 more but amazon delivery service quite irritating. best mobile under 15000 nice not to my expectations as i thought and read about it in advertisements. disappointed... i don\\'t get mobile charger along with the mobile.what shall i do now? good its a good product has heating problem. used both mi note 4 and k8 notei\\'m finding k8 better suited for memi note 4 is also a good phone dolby not support in i got it delivered on 19th february 2018. with in 71 days of purchase, by may 1st, the battery started showing complaint.every morning, from 6 am, i charge it to 100%. the charging was very fast, with in 2-3 hrs, it was getting fully charged.i start to use it by 8:00 am. usual usage like phone, whatsapp and fb. by 9:30 i reach office, after that, net usage only 10 mins average per hour. calls 2-3 mins average per hour.but the phone gets drained off to 0% by 1 pm.this was going on from may 1st to may 15th.from may 15th tuesday, it takes more than 8 hrs for charging.now, this is not a phone, mobile phone or smart phone. i have to keep it in charging all the time. evenings and travel are a night mare.you can imagine the feeling of a charge less phone in hand.the issue with customer service station is that, they work till evening 6 pm. i have to take an annual leave from office to get there before the closing hours. paisa vasool hai....good average this itam is very good but hitting mobile is good, but little costly had much issues with this phone not connecting to mobile network 2nd day of use it self. thus returned..! amazing phone. simply love it... camera is too good as well as performing well. headphone missing just loved the phone in such unbeatable price. also, the delivery was before given time. don\\'t buy this product wast your money, i was bought this phone one week before getting hanging issue, getting very very high heating look like iron box, camera poor quality its not 13 + 13 + 5 mp and its not 4gb ram finally it will take more time to changing battery backup also very poor. reviewing after 20 days of use.. don\\'t buy this product... heating problem... battery charging takes 7 to 8 hours...average camera...let\\'s see how warranty works out.. spec\\'s are high but performance is avarage.. very good handset great phone!! fine battery back not fine after oreo update phone is full of issue1. restarting automatically again and again2. no fast charging3. heating badly while charging and normal use4. battery drains very fast5. hotspot not working6. network not connectingin addition, it also lacks many good features as compared to k3 note1. smart office auto shift2. annoying screen capture sound3. app lock feature in the recent app4. pocket preventionwaste of money for useless product from lenovo good phone. camera quality is also good.fast downloading speed. low single depth camera not working i don\\'t like this phone maybe lenovo is going down hill... i had been using lenovo products and fell in love with them since 2012... but this? this is a joke...complains :-1. when i first use it... start up took around 8 minutes.. and even getting longer and longer the more often i restart the phone.2. when on call the volume automatically starts to come down to the lowest3. camera zooming is terrible.. front cam is terrible... can\\'t even take or screenshot a single while recording in video.4. battery need to be charged 2-4 times every single day and night5. lots of heating up when used or in charging mode6. phone hangs alot..i can\\'t believe lenovo has launch such a terrible phone... even the lenovo k5 note was better... which i had used before. ok i like this phone killer note battery backup is good compare with other phone camera quality awesome charge within 1 hour if u switch off the phone this phone good performance. this phone rear camara is not good and battery capacity is good. anyone mobile unbeatable it performance in this mobile left side speakers are not working. i tried for return back, but no response. earphones also not available in the box.camera is also not good sir i the battery back up is not good so i want to return it back and i want to buy other phone never buy worst product .....only loss of money crazy fast phone must buy don\\'t think. best phone. game performance very nice lenovo new system update till not there but amazon site purchase new mobile. is mention new system software update but there is no ore 8.0.0 update plsa help good mobile phone at this price range. value for money. heated several times otherwise good phone with great stock android expirience the best part is i love it the model of phn...little bit heatup while charging but that could be negligible..... yes.......a new mid ranged dual camera phone.this phone can be your daily driver,but dont except more from it.the specs are preety good....but i think its is overpriced.the camera quality is good....but i dont find it amazing.yes one thing i really like is the near stock android expirience with nougut.....and one bonus is the front flash...thatmay be a life saver in dark.at the end i think if you are giving 14000 (approx.).....you can buy mi a1 for only 15000. one of the best smartphones that you can get in this price range. stock android makes it even better. camera is average. battery can give you full 1 day backup, also takes less time to charge, thanks to turbo charger. i\\'m fully satisfie with my purchase. cash back ki baat boli gae thi jo avi tak toh nahi millano star frm my side a very good phone in the 13k budget. extra memory slot is biggest advantage compared with mi4 note, i found it wrong investment. the mobile which i purchase cheap as compared to the market price. their picture are too good. overall everything of the product are good. good becasue it is waste of time lvd it very good excellent smart phone very bad don\\'t go for this product mi a1 is better.i was very much disappointed. best mobile phones by lenovo at this time it\\'s gets very hot nice look and performance but useless gorilla glass worth every penny... best my phone got delivered on 28jan 18 and im using this from feb 2nd week onwards, yesterday it was feel from my hand from one feet highet and screen got damaged. request to lenovo company to replace with new screen glass you have send the already used piece .this phone used in september.this was strucking while using small applications. very bed mibile... after using lenovo k8 note for 4 days.... i came up with several bad experiencescons1) mobile charging was taking 8-10 hours for charging and sometimes more than that.2) very poor quality sound while using headset.3) mobile application operating speed slow.4) no in-built gallery and music player.5) network range always fetching up and down so battery drains quickly.6) automatically ringer volume shown on the screen.7) a bit heavy too.8) no turbocharger charging effect.😎 if two or more application opened mobile sometimes gets hang.i am totally unsatisfied with lenovo k8 note hence will not recommend anyone to purchase this phone. they are not providing refund instead they are providing replacement, after getting this much flaws, i was thinking of other company mobile options. after this many issues who will try to be part of risk of getting new product good. for proof i am adding images which shows mobile charging taking almost 10 hours showing at the bottom of image..prosmobile appearance good.camera quality good. good phone not a great one,camera quality not satisfied as per the specifications,but good,moto x-play have great colour display and clarity than lenovo, battery performance super.i can able watch a full one day cricket match with 4g and 30 percentage remaining after match(7 hours).good processor speed.you can buy without hesitation because the price is not high as per the specifications offered.. i want replacement good phone everything is... good. except the specific music key it\\'s slightly under the.. phone with half tilt and doesn\\'t working good phone but camera quality is not better than samsung..application occupie more space in ram mobile is very good. we do not get scratch guard and earphone. so far very much happy with the performance. lenovo bunch of waste people.... just no response for there utter flop software update... they turning the good handset into bombs by the latest update... after the latest update ... god... i was confused did i pircjase a mobile or iron box... super mobile k cast screen mirroring option not working. don\\'t know whether they provide updates soon or not. something is good and some is bad 3rd class mobile, charging problem , been using this device for last 90 days or so and here are my findings about it.cons:1. rear camera perfomance is average, even with the patch update, the photos feel average, the bokeh effect is absolutely below par,2. battery life is below average, despite being a 4000mah , the device does not last a 1 day, even on medium usage, the phone idle and screen it self consumes half the power. the recent update made the battery life worse.3. despite having a fingerprint scanner, it does not have native app lock feature, and we have to download a third party app for locking apps.4. memory management is not up to the mark. on first boot, out of 3gb, only about 1.2 gb was free, despite being a stock android, it has a heavy memory footprint despite not having any apps installed.5. signal reception even on strong coverage areas is poor, tested with idea/jio/vodafone all show very weak signal strength, my other honor device has no issues picking up signal at the same locations.6. turbo charger failed to live up to it\\'s potential after the recent november update, the device takes more then 110-130 minutes to fully charge,worthwhile to note, all the above problems could be solved via better ota updates but lenovo does have a strong update policy because of which earlier devices performed poorly after launchpro\\'s:1. great build quality, device feels very premium thanks to the series 6000 aluminium build,2. stock android os offers up a lag free operation,3. dolby sound is a very good offering, even without stereo speakers, the device outs good audio,4. the front camera with flash is a good feature and the camera does perform well, last offer purchase my mobile rs.12999. now live offers rs.11999. i am upset mind. good superb performance.....simply superb..... hi teamthis is the second time i\\'m purchasing this phone and i\\'m really sorry to say this...compared to the first purchase, this one is certainly a defective piece.case in point : the sound clarity in the previous one was so good you\\'d be actually feeling the entire sequence of events... however, considering this piece you\\'ve sent...i can\\'t stop saying how resentful i am of this contraption!i would like a replacement for the product as soon as possible! please replace my mobile it\\'s battery is not working and. in speakers also have problem good handset very delicate screen ,dose not have gorilla glass protection. blue tooth dose not works. screen break within a month. dose not have back button. camera is good. awesome product, very happy with the performance n built qualify. defective product. battery drains faster and doesn\\'t charges even heats up immediately while charging or using app. now when i m trying to return amazon asks for smartchk app to download. this app is a fraud app and shows that phone is proper. this app supports amazon worst phone 1.battery drains very fast2.heating nice charging is very very slow after 5 days heating issue it is strange that it does not have few features which were part of k3 note.alarm does not work at all if the phone if switched off.. this is not acceptablebackground app settings are not available. v good phone is good for use it does all the task easily . but there are some software bugs which are not addressed by lenovo in last updates. it does show some minnor lags sometime. battery is draining fast even without use. scrapproduct. even without the usage the phone charge is draining fastly got some heating issues. otherwise it\\'s good one to pick in this budget. bad product experience back camera is not gud....... front camera is amazing 💗 after a month only,found that only one speaker is working. not satisfied with the product.return window is also closed. now i have to go for service. manufacturing and quality check department didn\\'t do their job well.purchasers please check whether this fault is in your handset also. bad product..many bugs please don\\'t buy. xlent prodict everything is excellent about the mobile & stands best in performance, battery also good, camera is awesome this mobile processor very hot first of all no other phone in this price have cameras (both primary and secondary)better than this phone . with a mediatek\\'s deca core chipset it\\'s quite faster in multiple operations but ya it drains battery faster in compare to snapdragon . but it can be managed though company\\'s software update.secondly it\\'s really tougher in term of built quality .it have a nanocoting protection for water resistivity , it can even work after bent and it also have a gorilla glass protection.all these features are available in just 13,000/- which are missing in xiomi note4, honor etc lying in same price range. 1 star for its so called gorilla screen. i purchased the mobile just 25 days before and my screen broken. i was the proud user of kenobi vibe k5 note. but this is just bakwas no .fucher normal mobil only superb mobile... i m reviewing on this after one week of use . plz don\\'t listen to other comments . its got the awesome camera in this class even better thanmoto g5s plus and redmi note 4 . decacore processer is also best in its class . battery is decent . buy this without any second thought . it will pay u all the money u spend super never buy, bluetooth not working properly. heating issue. cast not working charger is not working in its 3rd month. no camera clarity it is a very nice smart phone.battery back up is satisfactory.camera is fine and enable you to take

🙁 poor performance. horrible experience.the bluetooth and wireless are not connecting.all these days i thought reiter have problem at my end.but when i called a technician l came to know that it is

happy. battery not up to the specvolume while watching movies and listening songs is near zeroneed to use volume booster which kills the quality lots of bugs heating problem, and battery backup is also less. and amazon delivery is worst. very bad quality of phone .within 6 month i face lots of hardware issue along with software .display screen damaged , black spot observed .audio pin damaged .ringing volume and audio quality become worst .too much heating problem , battery backup also very low .too much software issues like not receiving inbox message ,reigning volume is mute without user action etc tec …my advice please don\\'t west your money by see only features , good luck not good heavy, camera quality is not so good not a good product many issues in headphone jack software apps shuts done suddenly not gud camera in love light it\\'s the jack of all trades but king of none. battery back up could have been better if they used some other processor. battery drains quite fast. camera is better than average. and i think there is no option to keep external media as your ringtone. only custom build ringtones available to set as your ringtone. kinda bums me out.update after 3 day use:battery back up is really horrible, normal usage like whatsapp and instagram browsing consumes more than 25% battery in an hour or so.then there is turbocharging issue, it starts with fast charging then after 10-20 minutes,depending upon mood, rate decreases, it took 7 hours to charge it by 40% in total.would really appreciate if amazon could take this matter seriously and take it up with lenovo and return the money of its customers for defective models. i personally would not trust my 14k bucks with lenovo or moto from this point on. best camera performance super this is the killer smartphone at this price range.only dual camera has dispointed. overall great performance, selfie camera is goodi suggest to buy this phone. i have been using this phone about 8 monthsthere are lot of issue.battery drains very quickly.heating issuecamera quality is very bad.i faced network issue with lenovo. one of a sudden both network was lost and i have to give my phone to repair.worst part is lenovo customer care.i am totally disappointed with lenovo. i have been a customer of lenovo from past 3 years but now i m not gonna take any more product volte option not working properly i have purchase this phone 18th aug and phone is not working its software and hardware problem and lenovo service center executive told they will only repair this phone. within 20 days if found motherboard, hardware and software problem in the phone why not replace my phone. battery is creating problem for me charge is coming down very fast i don\\'t know what\\'s wrong with lenovo technical team mi mobiles will give update on continuous basis nearly all are user friendly but lenovo give update occassionally and loaded with many problems...shame on you team lenovo nice phonecamera is goodbattery is ok looks good so far after using 4 days.. one issue i found out that after activating the phone, every time i search for system update, a new update is shown available... updated the phone 3-4 times with various sizes of available updates...it\\'s like never ending. after each successful update, a new update is available... performance and battery wise its satisfactory. camera is just average. interface is nice and clean, just the way i like. good phone is auto restarting. and phone screen scratched.when opened the box. phone was not good and not worth for money super and fine... network disappears and weak. not volte very good bettery problem. very nice and functioning good not feeling like 4gb ram not even completed one year..phone started hanging and heating. i using this phone from 10th of jan it is not happy with performance of phone ,it is getting hang every time ,amazone has arranged technician he has factory reset after also the phone is not working properly ,technician has committed that if it not working properly then you will get new phone ,call center team is refusing that they have got a feedback that phone is working properly ,i have ask for new phone the lady from call center said we cant replace the phone ,it is 18 to 20 days gone but phone is not working properly , i am unsatisfied customer of amazon on their commitment waooo mobile best phone to buy. it has all the features in low cost. more feature are too good but there is auto call recorder facility is not available in this mobile. and this facility must be in my mobile. good service by amazon. heavily disappointed with basic features.. very worst very nice product satisfied good mobile don\\'t buy it please ..worst phone i have ever used hang problem, charger take too much time to full charge and its my humble request to all of you plz don\\'t buy it.. after 3 months green line on screen.after 1 year motherboard of phone die.lenovo you phone are discussting . battery is draining fast. no earphones, gallery is missing, voice recording is missing, no warranty mentioned, sound very poor. proceser is best but battery backup not good as per battery capacity, camera verry good just ordered...expecting minimum standards...and comfortable support awesome screen & touch response, battery performance is quite good compare to rn4 minor heating issue while playing high end graphic game otherwise stock android experience is excellent, memory management is very impressive. the phone keeps switching off for no reason every few minutes...even when battery is full and amazon/supplier do not consider this as a defective piece. this has made me sad. great quality camera and powerful processor it\\'s a good phone regarding the price the product was received without damage and works smoothly as expected dolby is not working, right did not working no oreo update otherwise phone is good good phone,nice battery,nice dual camera,heating problem during charging awesome phone to use in low budget , i gifted this phone to some one and after few months when i asked for feed back i heard positive words nice not good -1 starhuge disappointment....over heatingfalse turbo charging....not at all worth it\\'s price camera quality atxa nahi really trust me i have to thish phone great phone..the best in this segment awesome i paid only rs.10800 for this smartphone and it is better than redmi note 4 in terms of speed.but it\\'s dual camera feature is overhyped. previous lenovo lower version conked out after 3-4 years. it fell down around 100 times but developed no cracks. so trying this for now. redmi 5 some say is a better bet. except from the secondary camera bokeh blunder rest phone is very good. some software issue such as ram management and slightly warm while extensive usage can be fixed via software update. otherwise phone is good. there is no extensive heating issues. no lag whatsoever..overall a good phone.definitely recommend.update:this phone is really a piece of shit. i simply won\\'t recommend this phone to anyone else. wow superb phone camera is rlly good like dsle just osm very good phone no handing heating problem faced till nowonly problem is back cover not available on most of shops awesome product... great value for money very nice looking battery backup long time, camera quality is very good bulky phone. depth mode is needs improvement. gaming performance is very good . battery is powerful. front cam is awesome . heating problem is there, even after update to oreo version. phone sometimes hangs. expectations are not meeting as per it\\'s configurations. the piece i got is not supporting any earphones properly. the audio jack of the earphones is not going fully inside the socket. though the earphones work they are very loose and comes out very easily. is it supposed to be like that or i got a faulty piece? best worst experience ever. the lenovo k8 note has serious battery drain issues. it drains a lot during standby. i lost around 30% . just during my 6hrs of sleep. and amazon is not accepting return. it ran some stupid smartchk app. which does not even list the issue mentioned. very much unsatisfied and stuck with the product worst phone one side speaker not workingamazon purchases west not recommend product, facing some issues in this mobile. first no notification lights in this set, battery drain issue, heating problem, camera depth mode not good, sound of this phon not loud. phon comes with without handsfree. before this phon i was using lenovo k4note. i this k4 note much better from k8 note...very disappointed from this purchase... nice phone with good features. sim tray stuck i bought the phn yesterday already it\\'s stuck other than dat a gud one it\\'s an amazing phone. worth every penny spent screen faded off, screen not working, phone purchased 1 month back only. need to return the same. please help too much heating. it is inferior to other lenevo phone which i am using. very nice phone.. especially the camera quality is so good. value for money... battery drains fast, location accuracy issue...it will show incorrect location always....ringet volume is not much audible....was out of station by the time return timeframe exceeded... 😗 worst product actually it is below expected in camera. overall it is good for it\\'s price good working super bekar mobile hai .aur service ki bhi vyawastha bhi hai.custemer care bhi online product ko lene se inkar krte hai. nice phone performance is not up to date .... lte .... camera deep sensing is useless display problem in my phone ,when seeing captured photo small lines arriving on image i want to return it.it gets hot while talking, i am an engineer and i am sure it will not last long.i already raised my complaint as i want to return this product but amazon is not listening.feeling cheatedi wonder if i can give negative stars. hiii all.i have used this phone from last 3 days.here is my reviewpros:1. the metal body gives a classic and stylish look2. internal memory 64 gb in this range awesome with 4 gb ram.3.touch is very good with full hd.4.video recording in slow motion is also available.5.new processor is fast but not as compared with snapdragon 825.cons:1. the camera quality is very poor though it has extra camera in back.similarly front camera of 13mp is not up to mark and it\\'s look like fake images.2.battery which claimed to to be of 4000mah is just like 3000mah of samsung or other phones.it drains out within 16-24hr time.3.turbo charging,lenevo just fooling customers in this section it takes almost 2.5 hr to charge complete mobile.4.it doesn\\'t have separate ring volume adjustment for media alaram message etc.5.no headphones provided by lenevo in this set. camera performance is some what satisfied but overall good device it\\'s the worst mobile set i ever purchased. no battery backup, nothing good with this android system . i am using this phone since one month..i liked the sound,camera, big internal memory 64 gb,however only 50 gb is available for the use but this is also enough.good this about this phone is dolby sound and turbo charger which charges phone quickly and 4000mah battery easily last for 1 day even after watching videos,using internet ...thanks amazon for good packing and service. nice ok *charging speed is better than note4*camera is its usp*i don\\'t know why people r giving it 3.5 stars*display is somewhat hard to see in sunlight. not up to the mark .redmi is better then this. bad don\\'t recommend. worst performance nice back cover was not new...having many scratches its nice mobile, smooth operating , not hung all over too good. hi guys i have received it yesterday only. the 2 main problems are1 . heating issue - though not installed many apps as yesterday only received the handset but still getting very hot2. charging and battery issue - even after turbo charger it\\'s taking more then 4 he to charge and battery got drained in 8hr only with very limited use of phoneso plz suggest is it normal or having issue in my handset . should i return it??? i\\'m happy this is good product mobile smartphone, it is excellent looking bueatiful light weight, i like it. excellent nice mobile i loved it... i am disappointed with the packing of the phone it came like rapped in a carbage bag...😫 os occupies 16 gb of mobile space ...☹️nice camera some effects are missing black and white bokeh effect is not available ... 😒battery is good...😊overall nice mobile at it cost ...👍 nice mobile ,with current features. would be better if the phone is provided with backlight for the function keys.user interface is bad. battery drains drastically when kept idle and heats up lot.got defective product with dead pixels on the screen i like this product but disappointed from battery even 4000 mah in morning fully charged 100% at end of day it\\'s discharge 0%. remote function not working nice phone &best pert of part in camara excellent performance the company cheated. within a week the price of the phone dropped ny 1000. camera just good phone looking excellent battery backup good speaker sound nice and heating problem totally is good i purchased this phone on 25th august, hence writing this review after almost 3.5 months of use.there are problems i have with this phone1. clock: if you are using the phone with display on, the clock doesn\\'t change, it remains still. you won\\'t realize the time even after 30 minutes. it\\'s annoying2. wifi: it doesn\\'t connect to the wifi every time. you may have to restart this device to get it done.3. heating: the phone heats up during charging and heavy usage4. battery: my previous phone with 3500 mah lasted more than this phone\\'s 4000 mah. the battery performance is bad according to me.5. full charge: it takes more than two hours for the phone to get charged.6. display: display is okay. (if you are an amoled fan, you will be disappointed with this)good points:1. performance: 4gb ram does justice to phone\\'s performance. no lags noticed even with heavy usage and many apps2. camera: camera quality is good. also, the portrait mode.at 13,999 i believe there are better options in the market.overall rating: 3/5 compared to all brands in this range like moto,nokia,samsung it gives complete value for money. whether it is battery,storage,camera, video,sound,style or any other criteria k8 note is unbeatable in rs15000 range, anybody can blindly go for it i go value for money. the battery lasts 2 days. simplistic. nothing fancy and ostentatious. value for money spent. both lenovo and motorola are good. reasonable budget phones. good phone. don\\'t buy for dual camera setup. excellent... accept heating issue,cam, battery excellent phone must buy product is good. but heating problem and battery drain is biggest. i bought this on 1st march this year. sometimes very slow. i want to replace it now. also while typing it takes wrong words awesome experience of a smart phone...100 out of 100. the superb change which is in this mobile is not felt till now is heating problem in lenevo mobiles....the only thing required is to provide lenevo headphones....for experiencing the dolby atmosphere... voice recorder is not thereand gallery tooonly google photos is not enoughrest is best very good products i received the product on 29-apr-2018. when i checked the warranty details it\\'s showing product purchased on 30-09-2017 and warranty will expire on 28-12-2018. i am not getting 1 year warranty. it seems this is a used product. all thing and service is good thankyu more heating and battery service is very low too awesome i used k4 and k5 noye as well but this one changed the whole expirence.. helio processor is really too fast and awesome.. i am a normal user . its a good mobile. battery comes for 2 days fully , its a quick charger. image quality is good if picture taken out side. after the latest update..now it\\'s good... very good phone at this price...ram n storage...camera n battery all fabulous.... battery drains very fast. and not charge as details given nice phone. good camera battery backup is less as compared to redmi phones phone is hanging a lot after just purcahse of 20 days ...this is really heart breaking good very good beutifull body ..smooth function.....charming sound scrinquality in not betar excellent average phone. not for gamers. phone heats up and battery drains while playing asphalt 8. dabba phone.. sound is most ordinary, infact worse than other phones. all the dolby atmos is nothing but a gimmick. ovweall a good buy though, given the specifications and price. looking good and quality camera superb #name? just average worst phone ever decent battery life and performance considering the price. product is fine.i want to say that 10% cash back offer have available on lenovo k8 note and micromax spark smart phone.but i am not find cash back , why. i have done to more time purchased this items. not perfect as per my expectation.k5 note is more good than k8 note.. liked it excellent pros; good performance, storage, dolby, play pause button.cons; bttry prblm, heating problem, netwrk issue, back camera is not gud at al. i dont think it is worth to buy this phone as the camera quality is bad .pictures are blurred .expected 13mp camera picture will behigh quailty ones.but it is disappointing.after spending 13k on such phones not receiving quality is highly disappointing.i suggest not to buy this phone at all.funny part is i purchased it on sale from amazon as if it is a high quality product.. awesome phonecamera result is awesomelove this phonepaisa vasool phone have used it for couple of days now. phone feels good.but battery is disappointing. in this lenovo k8 note no dual 4g sim support and sometimes it stucks worst phone with worst services pathetic phone.. it \"always\" overheats after using large applications. after 8 months the phone had a starting problem, and the circuit board was 100% damaged as it was the software problem. the service center took 200rs charge just to inform that the phone is no good and upon repairing it will cost 17000 which is hysterical! cz its more than the price of phone. it was not covered under warranty as there was a minor crack on its cover. please dont waste your money for this crappy phone also the service center experience was negative and least helpful. camera quality is not bad, otherwise ok but it\\'s too costly when compared mi phone not compair with samsung j7 series i bought this phone one week before and returned within a week. it was not that great as it has specification. i was not able to pick up call because of display issue.look: normal phonememory: excellentcamera: very gooddisplay: normalprocessor: not as per spec. overall good but ui is worst, customisation is not so good phone is good but heating very much. and bettary daily i have to charge. bill good service i like it i was using lenovo k4 note before. i bought this phone with great expectations, but it is not at all up to the mark.1) camera quality is very poor. redmi note 4 is way better than this.2) heating issue, the phone heats even after 5 mins of playing a game or using camera3) loudspeaker quality is not at all good. i think i received a defective piece. volume of the speaker is also very less. very much disappointed with that.4) battery drains very fast, even when the phone is idle.5) phone brightness is very low. the maximum brightness level is very low.lenovo is fooling people by manufacturing these kinds of phones.buying this phone was my worst decision ever.dont ever go for this phone. overall performance ok. battery heating issue. media volume, phone ringtone volume too low. not easily audiable. its ok very good product from lenovo on time delivery. no complaints overall ok only drawback charging using turbo charger is not so fast as expected,display and camera is good. it\\'s been showing me hell since a software update by lenovo itself. the phone doesn\\'t unlock when you want it to.the screen turns on after a whopping10 seconds 😑😑. the system ui stops frequently.the bluetooth stops frequently.the battery is ok. product cost rs.11k and screen replacement for product under warranty costs rs. 5000. excellent.value for money.performing very well. very nice phonebut camera is average worth for the moneycamera goodprocessing speed good good product.... good to use and other things are also fine. excellent phone.. with it\\'s performances.. but camera is very poor.. battery pack up is awesome k8 good but the battery is not coming for long time as described and camera shot not clear as i used lenova a7000 good phone thank you amazon this product had an heating issue and battery backup is also not gud i want to say that had to use snapdragon chipset in this phone then this will be great very nice lenovo k8 note performance is very good......but only the problem battery is draining.....as i have buy phone...2 weeks before .....im facing the problem of battery no headset in box sir mene jo ye mobile buy kiya tha iska abhi tk cash back not mila he veri good phone intl this range and very fast processing nyz phone and best better price it is a real killer note. the phone is very good. good product.reached my expectations. mobaile is very good. camera quality is supub. screen is very atractive. worst of money to buy this product osm it\\'s working extraordinary with all features and it is the only phone with many features even others doesn\\'t have.and with reasonable cost. awesome mobile is awesome. very nice phone good mobile phone no busy i\\'m hart dis mobile not good working not good best stock android phone, no problem of heating it\\'s awesome super mobile i buy it on 22 january 2018 at rs. 9,999.00 really amazing phone at this price.overall performance is good. selfie and back camera is awesome front camera has flash. value for moneybeats all other devices in this price range. bad result it is good for gaming, performance,ram,less heating effect it is best but his charger is not good  it is a good mobile. the ui is not that fluent. sometimes it may go sluggish. at day time its dual camera performs very well with good bukeh effect. but its camera is terrible at night. it does not give many features but it is a good phone when we consider its price. front camera does not give a really good performance. go for it, this handset is very good there is no protection glass. ...they said gurrilla glassbut there is no glass. for it thinking to buy then better u donate money to someone else it\\'s working gud, and camera quality amazing. battery backup is not so good as compared to a redmi 4x and camera heats up a lot average of 15 minutes and battery will skip from 88to 86 and 38 to 36% my words is true ish mobile me dono sim 4g nahi hai osam phone i like it good excellent phone, promised battery life is 2 days but it\\'s a day or 1.5 days mobile not working proper, some problems facing. android system is not working properly. fast delivery. good product. nice handset.... best still 🔋 sucksphone is amazing but battery still sucks.... not much exciting..but very good product..camera quality of front is very good.back camera is not bad.but good battery drain very fastly in phone idle. not recommend to any one. very eagerly bought this...everything destroyed...good configuration and design..but noting is working.. by starting wifi is not working..not identifying wifi device....then started with mobile data..and heat is increasing automatically , the while using the mobile without charging...i hate this...i am going to return this today good i using jio sim. even my mobile in on and network is present it says not reachable to calling person. when my mobile display is on it\\'s works properly if we lock the screen this problem occur. i also replace the sim again this problem occur. nice this phone very bad.big network issue.and amazon not solve problems.iam very disappointed.i hate amazon very good product excellent super phone now am going to use this..well see the performance of this i bought the handset on 30th aug and within 3 months it has started giving multiple problems..the phone hangs multiple times and i can\\'t make any calls..the contact details disappear from the screen and i am unable to make any calls. similar when i receive the call the display becomes blank .. the customer care number for amazon 1800 3000 9009 is also of no help.. me buy 14000 rs nice phone. camera is good, battery life is better. display is smooth. volume is not that great. didnt hang till date, dont know in future. doesnt get heat. takes more time than promised to get charged. this doesnt seems like turbo charger. it\\'s amaaazing best phone n good service battery is not good and network problem i didn\\'t find head phone in the box.this is cheating. awsm very nice phone nice phone but i think you neet to install third party camera app just one word \\'wow\\'. good phone phone is ultimately good but second dule camera not useful very go may kindly be continue the same order very nice, mobile charging superb,battery backup very nice,but alarm not working when mobile switch off. excellent smartphone in a just 1 month of span of time camera is not functioning properly.not getting details of lenovo service care also nice mobile don\\'t buy this phone battery is not good.. i want to returned but policy was very poor... will never ever buy lenovo... micromax\\'s 2700 mah battery is far better than lenovo\\'s 4000 mah.. camera is also not so good... fine gold color phone is bad actually dont buy guys... superrrbut battery broblem issue excellent sorry for my earlier feedback. i tested the phone with defective headphones. everything is fine with the phone handset is good has a problem in notification..can\\'t get rid of the notification things which comes as a pop up in the screen..hence reducing battery lifw battery backup is very bad. heating problem nice phonepros:*2.3 ghz deca core*camera*fast charging*display quality*stock android*android oreo*separate sim & sdcard slotsand much more....cons:-heating issue-below average battery life-issues while playing games with high endgraphics. bad video clarity, no call recorder, no gallery, bad contact manager, bad rear camera and very less function in it\\'s setting... normal speed with 4gb ram, over all normal function s and not available call recording bettry low,camra good lenovo k8 note is \"on paper\" the best phone in budget phone segment. it\\'s a killer phone only if you go by specifications otherwise it\\'s a total wastage of your 13-14k.the build quality is ok. nothing in this phone is above average. either it is average or below average.let me tell you why one should not buy it.1) i used jio sim for my lenovo k8 note. the problem is when the phone remains idle for 10mins or something it goes in standby mode i.e. if someone calls me, the caller hears that the phone is switched off but in actual phone is not switched off. the moment i unlock the phone and someone calls me at that time it works fine.so it\\'s the biggest disappointment. it feels i bought video game for 14k. and this is not happening random. it happens every time when phone remains idle for more than 10mins.2) network connectivity: network connectivity is very poor in this phone. i tried sim cards from same service provider at same location in two different handsets out of which one is lenovo k8 note, and my observation is the other handset gets full network signal but lenovo k8 note always shows one-two bar less and that affects the call quality.3) even though it is having 4000mah battery, the battery performance is very poor. it drains very fast even in idle condition.4) if you are movie/tv series lover and spend most of your time watching videos on phone then this phone will irritate you. things is when you watch videos on this phone, the screen gets flickering every now and then. it is the most irritating thing. even after turning auto brightness mode off, the screen keeps flickering.5) stock android at it\\'s worst in this phone.6) dolby atmos is not doing any magic. normal music output.7) the hard keys (power, volume, music) are not firm. it is very loosely connect and having too much play. even your older phone may not have that much play even after years of usage.8) microphone output is very low so no good calling experience. it may be because of poor network connectivity as i mentioned earlier.9) dual camera feature has nothing special. even third party apps can provide better results than this so called \"depth mode\" camera feature. overall average camera output.10) no backlight for soft keys. you have to keep searching for soft keys in darkness.all above drawbacks are not specific to my phone only. as i faced these problems, i searched for solution online. instead of finding solution, i found out many people are having similar issues with their lenovo k8 note.apart from phone, i give full marks to amazon for the hassle free return of lenovo k8 note.amazon should refrain itself from selling this phone.hope my review will help people who wants to buy this \"killer phone\". mobile is good but earphone is not delivery that is bad product lost money that is wrong camera quality is very very poor. good phone many setting options are not available in this smartphone. so first check and compare the setting features then buy it. heating problembattery drying fastly.charging time upto 4 hours to 1 to 100%. awesome phone it\\'s a ok mobile, does not charge quickly as it is suppose to do worst product from lenova. please don\\'t buy this product and waste your money.issue 1: system upgrade is not happening which is provided by lenova.issue 2: system hangs while selecting the network provide and while entering the pin to unlock the device after restarting.please don\\'t buy this product and waste your money...suganthan.please don\\'t buy this product from darshita electronics. they have defective products for customers. battery is worst, even it not work half day (less than 16 hours). if we play music, with in 3 hours it going to be discharge. :-( other than, it is just ok. not wow... this mobile is waste battery low power do not buy low volume used phone delivered to me mobis working fine .camera is ok.for gaming perfect mob in the product description it has been stated that the network is 4g+4g. but actually u can have only one 4g sim.. terriblealso finger sensor is not working properly its hard to use,boring to use.it have unwantedand unuseful features a good quality phone. everything as expected. camera is nice and battery lasts the entire day if not used for hotspot. fudu phone packaging was not so good.i thought the product was not inside. when i opened the package it was there. package must be good soz the product won\\'t get damaged. nice and amazing mobile... faster processer and high gb storage.. great pictures clarity my humble request to lenovo, please provide gallery(sparate not google photos), media player, voice recording and provide sparate options for storage contacts in sims and call recording in new software updates, which are the most basic features of phone every phone🤔🤔🤔 niceorder all in all good product with few shortcomings. but dual camera is disappointing. overall a good device.battery lasts all day of normal usage but not up to the mark of 4000 mah.performance have no issues.while gaming for a longer session device gets little warm.still it\\'s the best in its price segment.the one that i used got its display damaged on a drop test. gorilla glass is a myth for this device.slightly bigger in size, 5.5 inch display isn\\'t so comfortable to hold. mind glow phone look like it\\'s have strong phone form lenovo the \"charge within minutes\" is an absolute lie. this device takes 9-10 hours to charge on a normal charger and 5 hours on the original turbo charger. very nice camera & good quality dolly speakers. very best phone give fight to mi note 5 pro 😀 received so early than expected and good. not support 4g on dule slot

battery is good , camera in daylight specially depth mode is good, touch screen feel very good, feels bad when headphone is not present. it\\'s ok camera quality is not good as said in paper. phone looks good . batey not good.jio sim signal problam.heating problamcamera is good. very very good mobile, excellent camera, battery music system phone is good but lite heating and battery backup is normal very nice good product very good bad battery performance it\\'s good product...thanks amazon.. i am dispointed with service centre\\'s service. my mobile display dameged by shorting problam but service centre empoley told me that it is liquid problem.so we have to change mobile folder and you sould pay chaeges.. a phone which is delivering what its meant to be. any applications can be downloaded of our choices. and its really a lots of space saving. good battery and really smooth performance.for photography sorry this is a smart phone not a dslr . thanx amazing features in the best price great phone(with first it\\'s was the battery issue and with the replacement well it didn\\'t even starred)with the dirt i was having an issue with the battery as when it reaches 15%it\\'s goes to zero within 1 or 2 minutes straight.happening continuesly thoughand now the replacement phone wellit didn\\'t even started its just like a brick.it\\'s all due to bad seller which makes amazon looks even worsewhy can\\'t you deliver a product which works just fine..... seller made my new year excellent best product at this price it\\'s not a corning gorilla glass .& security patch is september 2017 .signal reseption is very very poor .camera not working properly .& it\\'s have a metel body so it\\'s drop everywhere .so you have to keep case for phone .& heating is very high .display is not good .i love k series phones but it\\'s a worst product from lenovo k series . are you are a hard-core gamer and needs performance rather than camera? if yes, definitely go for it. unbelievable phone excellent device with unique features..... great features but the only disappointment is that earphone is missing from the pack. it came as a real shocker that after investing inr 13999 , still don\\'t get a earphone this is not a complete product.battery backup is very bad.using time it is very hot low price this is one of the best phone perfect phone is good but there is one thing which is not there & that is screen shot, screen shot is not available in phone. it is a very good gadget.only, the music key on the left does not work, for my set. awesome.... good phone but little heavy and some time the proximity sensor doesn\\'t work fine. rest all is good for the price which u have to pay. phone is good but there were too much heating problem of this phone after 4 months of using will charging it.pleaseeeee amazon replace this phone too new lenovo k8 note. poor battery performance. it gets drained very fast and do not charge phone quickly. no turbo charging. a decent phone on budget.pros: nice specs at this price, brightnesscons: the biggest drawback is music and sound quality. dolby atmos is useless and is given to fool people. even the older lenovo devices have got far better sound. i am a music lover and purchased this device but super disappointed now.update: mobile suddenly stopped working within 3 days of usage. it is not powering \\'on\\' now, waiting for resolution from amazon\\'s end. except camera quality mobile performance is good pretty good phone, camera is awesome..battery lasts 2days ..over all a good buy very worst handset it doesn\\'t have direct casting instud it requires google crome to connect smart tv as the phone have 4000mh batter, the phone doesn\\'t last for a day even without internet. when we call to coustomer care regarding the direct casting they speak very lightly. the lenova k5 note was far better then k8note. i guess this all have happened coz of motorola tookover the lenova product.. nice best mobile at this price worst battery performance....battery drains very fast on standby. nice, satisfied to this product worst product dont buying in any one.phone working slowly and handle notsmooth horrible product first i received this product without any earphones now about a week after purchase while getting into my quilt i mistakenly put my hand on it and discovered the screen cracked as a resultwhat a waste of money don\\'t know what recourse i have at this point i am using this phone and find -phone is getting heat, camera is not good as expected, battery is also not good as expected . i have read lot of reviews after buying the product and thought the reviews were some bad experience with few people. and there were few positive reviews as well hence went on to buy this product. i was using a k3 note before.my review based on a week\\'s usagepositives:1. good camera2. good speed3. good battery charge4. good storagenegatives:1. call quality bad, basic requirement of a phone2. dolby atmos performance bad, doesn\\'t even match with my k3 noteplanning to return the phone superb mobile for 11000/- but software issue. can\\'t use some applications. turbo charger not properly working .purchased date only properly working.waste product my name satish chavhan i got mobile with cover and there is problem in front camera.low class images in front camera but rear camera is good.i confirmed from other friends but they got mobile without cover and their front camera is ok.mobile having some software issue also.this was my last product of amazon.i will not buy any product from amazon today onwards. nice phone. full review in short good phone and smooth experience but some cons:-1.depth enabled camera is not that good,normal camera is crystal clear.2.update doesn\\'t seem to make any difference.3.overheat when on 4g4.screenguards available does not fit the screen as it is a bit curved.pros:-1.front camera rocks during the day2.scrath resistant screen.really!!3.includes microsoft word,excel,powerpoint etc..4.big screen for smooth use.5.vr stunnsan indepth photo attached alongwith normal ones. packaging sucks, there were bubbles an on screen some scratches on back cover too but most of all the sim ejector tool is missing.. never gonna buy lenovo products again. worth it but the sound quality is good but the volume level of the speakers in not up to the mark even in earphone too best product and amazing delivery signal range is poor good phone with lesser price it\\'s a good product i m fully satisfied with it and i really love its camera great experience with tis amazing product from lenovo.it is equipped with almost every features that a smartphone required.deca core processor long lasting battery and 64gb internal memory with 4gb ram is just awesome.i would certainly recommend this phone for users having usage and game lovers average mobile,so many issue ,i think this is west of money battery not so longer to use horrible experience.i have got a vimbar instead of this phone.please do something immediately. didn\\'t like it too much like i do my k5 note, selfie camera doesn\\'t have mirror settings may be some update will be there in future, further more camera is not that good, dual camera is only for show doesn\\'t do anything good. one strange thing i noticed is missing headphones they are writing it in description but not available in box. good product..worth money...of not looking for extraordinarily camera this is for you to grab.. battery is not long lasting, it doesn\\'t feel like 4000 mah ..... started getting hot by continuous using, some times it slow while using very element phone in this category having very nice front and dual camera. decent phone to price tag ....found satisfactory in all terms......after using mi3, red mi 3s,red mi 4,red mi 5and some of samsung /motos found better pros:1.performance(deca core) is good2.storage(52gb ) is good3.ram(4b) performance is quite satisfactory no hang has observed so far.4. camera takes some really good pics in day light and nowhere in this price range you are gonna get 13 megapixel front camera with a selfie flash.5. people who love to have a lot of multimedia content in their phone as 52 gb of storage is quite enought for that kind of users.6. fingerprint sensor is amazing and far better than any andoid phone i have ever used. you\\'ll hardly get to clean it for months.7. since it is already aiming with corning gorilla glass so no need to add any screen guard as it can handle even knife point so details you can check its screen resistance in youtube videos.8. splash resistant so if by mistake you pour out your tea or water you will have your phone fully working without any damage.9. screen angle is very good so you can view movies by all possible angles.10. that music key is really awesome especially for the people who listen music and headphones and their phones usually keo in their pocket so next time you dont have to take out your phone and then change the track your can simple do it by double pressing music key.cons:1.camera is not up to the mark even my mi4i camera was better than this one especially in low light areas.2. if you are a kind of person who listen music at loud volume then this phone is not for you as its maximum loundness is very low as compared to other phones even my iphone 5s sounds better in my headphones than this one.3. updates will be delayed so if you are excited for the android oreo than you have to wait till july and june of 2018 as this is their officially announced date for the updates.4.back panel captured your sweat finger print pretty fast so don\\'t forget to get a back cover for it although lenovo provide a transparent plastic back cover but it\\'s better if you go for another option. i am not setisfide with this mobile k8 note set becouse i am facing heating probelom during charging and camera quality is very poor , betry drain very fast and terbo charging is not found it take more time during charging. good... mobile was good good look..... bt battery got heaten up quickly..... nd back dual camera is also not that much useful bt overall good thing to buy awesome phone again lenovo disaapoiting me. battery not providing proper backup as his description..heating issue facing again...interface not impressive.. ok ok performance not a good good cast doesn\\'t support in lenovo k8 note. audio quality is not as expected. best phn in day price... this is actually too soon to give an detailed review... so in a sentence..a budget phone which is good in the price range.. lags in speeds..reasonable camera...but ticks all the boxes unable to hot spot connection to p c via wifi connector overall a good phone in this price range.the faults which i came across are -•the phone takes a lot of time for deleting the camera captured images.•very poor flash light,feels like a dim halogen flash bulb.•major problem faced is the heating while playing high graphics games and apps and also during the charging.•only two colour options available.•depth enabled effect is not that up to the mark,but it\\'s a okay type thing.•battery backup isn\\'t that good as i thought. poor batterydon\\'t buy classic phone no issue.. ... rear camera is not powerful at this price and rear flash is yellow...is not comfortable... i want bill of this mobile in my mail by 23 of april 2017.. lenovo k8 note is the worst mobile that i bought till now . the battery is very poor even the charger is not good ,it take 7 hr to charge upto 90% and drains in 1 hr ...don\\'t buy this mobile it waste of money . 1.finger print not worth2. pls improve sms copy and paste3.not working contact list dialing good mobile battery backup not good. bad camera clearity.. nice phone. no lag. need to compromise in camera but worth for money 9901 rs.amazon delivery is too fast mobile is getting very heated for minimum of 2mins usage. battery is also getting drained very fast. good i have purchased this lenovi k8 note just few days back and came to know its 3 major drawbacks.1. no option for automatic network selection. if we enabled 4g/3g than it will search and connect with 4g/3g network and its not necessary that selected network is available everywhere.2. no in built call recorder and only one app on google play store with limited feature for call recording option.3. as usual heating problem.i just want to return this mobile set not good product don\\'t, buy this phone, this phone heating and camera problems etc... i have a complain about this product. it\\'s not charging the way it used to before, the charger given was turbo charger but it\\'s charging like a normal phone, it\\'s taking more than 2 hours to charge properly, and the battery gets drain too fast... please please please help me with this issue... the lenovo k8 note is good product. in this price range k8 note is better device compare to the other. the bit disappointing is hitting issue, because of decacore processor device hitted and battery should be more than 4000 mah. network not working properly compared to all other mobile phone battery draining too fast camera is ok even turbocharger also not so fast please return my money i feel cheated,also heating all over good condition..bt camera not good.... battery backup is not good...turbo charging is not working...it\\'s take 3-4 hours is 100% charging.... fetures is good and processing speed also well but battery is low, finally not bad battery is not so good as i expected if u continue use internet and games ,media battery will dry in 4 to 5 daysdisplay is smoothspeed performancevery low heating effect for game like asphalt which is goodcamera is avrge not good but also not bad4day review i was happy with the product after purchasing on may. but in sep suddenly i find that the charging port is not working... i went my nearby centre at serampore but they said that they are not taking... my phone is dead last couple of weeks change my phone hangs a lot. apps stop working all of a sudden. good poor service by amazon. i rcvd defected phone(myc not working). after complain i got another phone after replacement but still in this phone also have defect i.e. depth mode of camera is not working. :( :( hanging issues with normal performance is continues just like other phones. phone heating too much....battery is draining...20 hrs charging 4 hrs backup! good mobile...... but not a good mobile..... it takes lot of time for charging full battery, more than 6 hours for one full charge and heating problem.. excellent camera ...processing power full ..love it so much .....at this range this smartphone is best..thanku lenovo worst experience.:battery backup issueheating problemcamera is not as per mentioned specsdont buy this phone excellent produce most annoying with this phone is get heated up quickly, the other thing is the phone get jammed with call connection, i have check with other mobiles for same network provider and found that the call get jammed while connect the call .this mobile is certainly not a killer note.hope this information helps. best in features but battery drains very fast. very bad product battery are draining too fast battery is draining very fast otherwise nice phone excellent product good and very nice this phone is too heavy and feels like a rock in my jeans and 185 gms is actually quite heavy and is uncomfortable to hold. that depth mode in camera which they advertised is a joke and a gimmick. don\\'t buy this phone for camera. 5 mins of pokemon go and this device feels like i\\'m holding a hot pan. and 5 mins of listening to music also starts to heat up the device. you may think that this phone has 10 core processors so its heats up but why the hell would a phone heat up while listening to music and using camera, i have used many phones but i have never seen heating like this before. the top part of the back and the screen becomes very hot. the game lags when the device becomes hot and the battery starts to drain very fast (i used playing wifi and not 4g and i\\'m sure the device would become more hot while using 4g). i had to shut down the phone to cool it down. the ram management is very poor and sometimes apps will reload while heavy multi tasking. lenovo may fix these problems with software updates but lenovo is famously known for not pushing updates to any of its phone. i asked the customer care of lenovo if they\\'ll push any updates but they had no information regarding this matter. in my opinion, its better you skip this phone and pay rs.2000 extra for the moto g5s plus.i requested amazon to retun the product and they said to use the smartcheck app which showed a temperature of about 44 degrees celsius. amazon listened to the problem and they promptly sent a technician to my home and he frankly said to return the device as in a period of 6 months or so, this device would cause more problems and i did return this phone. thanks to an amazon agent, i got a refund instead of a replacement of this device which is against their policy. bad product. my charger has stopped working within 2 months. product is very nice but it\\'s processor is not renowned , it can cause slow functioning in the future..... worst phone i ever seen and i am completely disappointed with amazon don\\'t ever buy this phone this is my fourth smartphone i m using, it\\'s just fully loaded one all the features which im accepting. what a great smartphone. nice one to have . but one of the speaker isn\\'t working touch screen not working not so gud please don\\'t buy ,bakwas phone good mobile screen showing double icons right out of box and is froze 2 times , and i have not yet inserted my sim yet , quality not at all upto expectations,was supposed to be a gift, too bad, gotta return .check the images , network are not working it gets heat very frequently. contacts gets mixed with other contacts or gets only one contact number saved. complex application. nice screen, long battery life. best phone at this price range battery drainage rate is too faster.......much heating on 4g network.but camera and its display is awesome. after 1 month it\\'s working good hopes in future also work good coss the finger overall performance of phone is excellent but the dual camera and battery can be improved a lot i bought this phone on first sale and returned,because charging is very poor,its discharging in 4-5 hours,other wise ph is very good lenovo k8 note useless phone doesn\\'t have cast feature such a important option , please don\\'t get mad for this phone there are so many better phones in the market better opt for that...this is the absolute cheating from the company like lenovo don\\'t download any app which is more than a gb. good phone. nice product its such a amazing handset in its range fsb performance nice battery back up let me start with the cons firstcons :1) gps tracking is incorrect. if you use any activity tracking app for running, walking etc then get ready to see incorrect readings2) dual camera setup is a total gimmick feature. though primary 13mp is good.3) the front camera has some filter mode enabled by default which produces grainy pics. pro cam mode is better.4) phone heats up sometimes unnecessarily though not a big con.5) headphone/earphone volume output less6) dolby atmos is a big failure. it actually lowers the sound output.7) no backlit illuminated navigation buttons. get\\'s tough in dark.pro1) excellent power output.2) sound output good3) good voice clarity4) all features rather than the cons work perfectly.verdictfine for the price it is offered for but the phone doesn\\'t live up to the mark as compared to the publicity/marketing lenovo did for this product isn\\'t. 1.battery is problem it is draining just in4 hours if u brosing internet2.sometime all apps are automatically removed from ram.3.camera is not at all good very poor quality in artificial light and bad indoor both back and front4.heating is major issue.only in 10 min of youtube it will get heated. the dual camera setup don\\'t work properly and batter is giving me a backup of 6hrs only very poor phone don\\'t buy this i am repent afrer buy lenovo product... cause many problems1 is call recorder not working2 screen cast not working3 if screen off application install then finger print sancer not working...mamy problem face...i will not suggest anyone to buy lenovo product.... phone gets heat and very slow charging look wise phone is good. touch is good but when constant 2-3 hours of internet using phone temp. is increase. 2nd bad things is camera quality is bad comparison with other dual camera phone like mi.dolby facility is good battery back hours up not maintained as per your battery condition back camera not good,,,.. very good product,no any problem as of now mobile is gud but charging problem. it\\'s too good at the price. awesome mobile the piece is good looking , elegant . the short comings are no screen shot feature, signal reception is not up to mark. compared to k3 note it is way behind in internet running. its just okbattry is not good at all i pay from visa card for ur scheme 10% cash back. but not reverse it please suggest me name of call recording app in which both side of voice can be recorded clearly. the phone had problems like led light not working, camera was blurred and no 4g speed in the second sim. have visited the service center but it was unsatisafactory superb phone with amazing looks & many cons too.this phone comes with good camera good backup & good features as android n is loaded.the major pro of this phone is that u don\\'t need induction heater if u have purchased this phone.it heats up very fast and it\\'s heating effect last for at least two to three hours so if u do wanna cook u may make omlets on it.and it\\'s charging is also not that speed as mentioned in it\\'s catalog \"turbo\". do not buy lenovo k8 note. *not having inbuilt call recording.*non clarity sound speaker.the high speed charger unit faulty after first recharge.only buy lenovo k4 note. i expected all features of k4 note in k8 note but not found anything. battery discharge as a normal capacity mobile, 4000mah not showing performance. no extra features like mi note 4..while placing order its written there a headset ll be given, but no head set provided. its heating very much while charging... best to buy mi note 4 instead of it i am very happy purchasing this shoes delivered me fast from amazon..... mobile become heat when charging awesome phone in terms of processing and camera quality. this is the first time i could experience android phone having no lags while playing games. the only problem i could find is the phone charges for a long time even though it came with a turbo charger best product worth buying for the price.1. nice vibrant display and smooth stock android ui.2. performance is smooth without any lag issues. the phone doesn\\'t heat up during normal usage but with heavy gaming it tends to become quite warm(but still playable) and might be a concern for you if you\\'re an avid gamer.3.sound is ok, nothing special as there\\'s just one functional speaker on the bottom right. left one\\'s just for show.4. some features such as screen mirroring and call record(in phone app) options(usually included in lenovo phones) are missing but may be used with third party apps.5. both front and back cameras are decent enough for me but the depth effect(dual camera) doesn\\'t work that well.6.overall look is stylish and build quality is decent. doesn\\'t feel too heavy to hold and feels sturdy.7. battery life is ok you can get 10-11 hours of continuous usage(more time for normal everyday use). nice product plz give me a new update not so great not so bad ,average phone in this price range , no issue in this phone nice phone very very nice kurear k4 was better great budget phone and with stock android it is amazing camera is good but low light pictures are bit noisy depth mode is not good very much satisfied, nice camera faltu farod because i purchased a lenovo k8 note but i didn\\'t get a headphone with it in box some heat problem es. awesome phone great camera for selfe wonderful battery power good quality phone have been using it for 4+ months no issues so far.speaker phone quality could have been better bad product compare to mi phones.no any facility inbuilt loke video calling,call recorder,gallary,app lock etc. for all these we have to download application externally. please don buy this phone totally waste product... bluetooth issues camera and software issues are there in single word i tell that this phone is awesome.even redmi note 4 can\\'t beat this mobile. nice phonefeeling bad that i bought for 13999but now 2000 off amazing phone good front camera is not good.it\\'s better than 5mp camera of other phone. the phone is amazing it,s camera excellent and storage of moblie is brilliant . the best product i have buy in amazon it\\'s getting hot to hotter when i surfing on internet within two minutes.....its really bad.even i can\\'t hold the warmth -phone . nice phone but depth camera is not up to the mark bakwas phone . plz dont buy. battery discharge soon . heating issue. hanging problem. too many ads. red mi note 5 and note 5 pro is the best phone. but lenovo very bad phone. i rate 0 star if option is aval. not user friendly money wasted.. discovering new issues everyday.. jus frustrated.. everytime when data is turned on.. it shows \\'connected no internet\\' tried swtiching airplane mode but no internet.. internet resumes only after restart ..phone gets heating even at limited usage.. not receiving full signal.battery drains fast when low.. charging takes at least 3 hours..should have supplied with a ui..camera is average but not up to the expectation. low light capture no use..the plastic back cover supplied with the phone shows rainbow color due(melted) to phone heating issue..please look for quality feature phone that you can trust and buy and not the killer features.. lenovo has to come up with a update to resolve this else this would leave bad impression on the customer\\'sfirst ever phone that i\\'m totally disappointed.. huawei is it will heat up to 45°c prosgood luking, handy, good battery backup, good picture quality, good camera.consfirst piece which i received had problem with turbo charging and desktop screen, but amazon had changed it smoothly.you have to explore system a lot to put ringtone of your choice, i had to call lenovo customer care centre.system works abruptly, many times vibration works, many times it doesn\\'tsome time screen does not allow you to operate, other time it does not allow youoption for scrrenshot is not separately available, you can use the side button either for music or for screenshot. crop option not available for screenshot.easiness of using the phone is missing. happy to purchase of lenovo k8 note but one issue charger not working and all ready complaint but not solved worse camera i have ever seen nice little heavy good for the price with all features except the back cam excellent phone it\\'s very good product ..it have nice better. if you will have able provide head phone with phone ,, it will be good ... empty box satisfied with the purchase. best phone in comparison other brands this is the worst phone i ever used, i bought this phone and after 2 days its camera start disturbing after 2 days its both camera and flash light stop working, camera quality is not upto the mark as we can expect from dual camera, sound quality is good , looks and functionality good, battery backup is also not good as you can expect from 4000mah phone. then i thought that might be some technical problem so i order the replacement.here the amazon role come, they did the fantastic role, they plan the pick up from my home as per my request, and also arrange the replacement hear i got my replacement order after 10-12 days little late but no-problem i was quite satisfied with amazon service.but again problem come after 2-3 days in phone a red line start showing between the screen in new phone a new surprise for me. i am not satisfied at all with this phone but very happy with the service by amazon. now i am returning this phone and suggesting you to choose any other phone. next choice is yours. first of all i want to thank lenovo and amazon who made me so good a product,because this is stock android, it runs along and lenovo k8 note are not warm even after playing hoursno any problem playing games, connectivity so good together, this phone will give 8.5 out of 10 ratings awesome phone but it have heating issue otherwise perfect very poor performance heating problems not working hotspot properly mobile is good bt battery backup poor and network problem too. prodect and delivery is too good request for invoice for lenovo. k4 note other than camera i don\\'t find anything good. some features i m using in k4 r missing. best phone ever.. a decent phone for this price range. extremely fast while browsing and when multiple windows are open. decent front camera. rear camera reasonably ok for the price. phones gets heated up while charging, but it cools down immediately once the charging is over. it takes 2 hours for full charging. little over weight still design is handy and loving. no hanging or heating issues while using. battery last for more than a day with good usage of 4g. dolby atmos feature is really cool. overall a good budget phone from lenovo. so far so good. my priorities were internal memory, ram and battery back up. other features are similar to phones in this price range. there is a finger print sensor/phone lock mechanism which is great. the camera could have better in low light. in all, good purchase given the price. amazon delivery was on time as well. it does not has volte support. battery drains fast. when it was slightly fell down the screen glass corner broken. in product specification, it is informed that it is cornered with gorilla glass type 3 protection. i think product specification is fake. price worthy. please don\\'t buy this motherboard gone in three month of use heating issue and hung issue after 4 month...this is bundle phone.. don\\'t buy guys.. hang switch off phone product is good battery turbo charge is really good camera clarity is greatbut only has one issue heating problemrest all is good very bad mobile battery lifeit\\'s battery back up rarely 2-3 hours maximum. worst camera & ui, i didn\\'t expect this type of quality from lenovo,and one star * for amazon courier service, placed order on 25th aug and received on 1 sep there is no value for prime membership except prime videos. battery is the worst ever. and everyone knows about the heating issue.. nice phone very good phone nice phone... but headset pin not working battery very poor qukly discharged ,dolby system poor poor product. nice mobile average phone... awesome phone,,,camera superbbb,nice interfacer display screen is stuning...5 out of 5 ,,super happy with lenovo k8 note and amazon....thank you an amazing phone....pros-1. excellent cameras (both front selfie camera & rear primary camera) in this price range. even low light photography using flash in both the cameras was far better than other phones in the 15k range. the camera is fast and very responsive.2. a superfast phone for people who multitask a lot. didn\\'t even hang with heavy online gaming.3. superb battery backup. even with the data continuously on and continuous gaming the battery gives a backup of more than 6 hrs. lasts more than 12 hrs with normal usage. and with the turbo charging feature the phone charges real fast.4. the phone has a premium look.5. comes with preloaded microsoft office package.cons-1. is the company fooling us by saying that it\\'s a gorilla glass????? my phone fell lightly from less than a feet and the display got shattered. that phone is very good processor is also good look is also excelent nice product at this rate but not satisfied with battery and 📷 very bad build quality... after 3 months usage, i found severe heating problems and fast charging issues ( sofar i changed three fast charging cables due to hardware issues and u can\\'t charge with normal chargers), no big deal with camera, my car is not connecting with blue tooth, no casting over tv ..it\\'s simple brand phone but not worthy usage..u decide. not goodat all. waste of money. he nice.... working very nicely all r good but charger cable is not good another all r good finally this product is very good product nice piece, like the colour and performance too.. would recommend to buy this product... only issue was no headset with this mobile, which was surprising ... i\\'ve brought so many mobiles online, always got a charger and a headset 😣😣😣 so please check before you purchase.. 🙏🙏 nice excellent except phone gets warm very fast battery performance is not as described one simple word for this phone is awesome. headset is not provided with the box. also in this version gallery is not available so arranging your photos and videos are little difficult.would like to edit this review after using it so many days. problem after lenovo upgraded android version to naugat the real pain started. phone is reaching temperature upto 65℃. battery giving backup only upto 4-5 hrs after full charge even if you are not doing anything with it.called customer care and visited service center but they told me getting that much warm is normal.probably next time they if this phone burst will tell bursting is also normal. lenovo is bad mobile very nice phone, best stock android 7.0 it will receive latest security patch level update .best camerafast charging is goodfast performance . good phone but as i expected i purchased this phone on 22 aug flash sale. i was hoping to that it wld be killer phone. it has quite good specifications too. but most annoying issue i am facing since 1st day of delivery that it heats up so much for small usage . my palm get irritated . i tried to contact amazon but they said temp is below 45 degree celcius so it\\'s acceptable. and they denied replacement .i am feeling like being duped. i can\\'t hold phone more than 10 min in hand . after 15 days the calling speaker is not working. good phone in budget smartphone category camera expected to be more advance. my phone charging is very slow in 1 hr only 8% charge what can i do. not good as expected but still i trust on lenevo,camera quality is average phone like rs8000performance is also averagemusic little bit impressivefacing n/w issue ,also tested by net velocity and speed test app, no volt support is that reason i m getting poor signal issue i guess,so as expected lenevo is not

bad.. camera cheap quailty,battery backup is good.. please don\\'t buy online, my earphones missing nice mobile battery draining very quickly... and heating issue too.. it\\'s really very nice to use ...i gave 4 stars becoz it doesn\\'t contains some small features which is available in k4 note itself . nice phone not up to the mark, but camera is good. poor camera performance, heating problem, battery drains very fast.... disappointed with the product. used k3 note, k4 note, k5 note, k6 power. but this one is below them. good mobile with all facilities within a medium budget very poor network performance... network keep on fluctuating ranging 0-50%always gives not reachable message to caller this phone have some absent features,maybe music or video player. the phone will heat up sometime. pathetic..there are no basic features..like call or voice recordings..unable to get full tempered glass there are no tools folder available...want to return asap rear camera is only one is working i bought this to have dual camera if i close 2nd camera and take photos no change.turbo charger is not fast rather very slow. earphone not attached with phone not very satisfied with it, it just capture some good images, apart that nothing is good in this phone..sometimes lags too much, msgs just gone disppear for while, sometimes doesnt show the contact name, sometimes doesnt open the required app..before this phone. i was using lenovo p2, i thought, lenovo has upgraded this phn with some extraordinary apps, but this phone dissapointed me.. it\\'s good , feeling pleasant performances good mobile phone but camera is not good not enough battery the phone has good features on paper. even performance is fine. the thing is the back camera lens is very weak. it just got broken after 3 weeks of use. the mishap is happened unknowingly since my phone didn\\'t fall but i accept the fact that it might have happened due to keys maybe. service center quoted 2650 rupees for replace only back panel and yet the back panel is not available in service center. they are gonna order it from somewhere so the guy has to keep my phone for 2 days to complete procedure from his end. then they will return my phone and after 15 days the back panel will arrive. so again i need to hit their door. so now in two days i am afraid that they shouldn\\'t stole any spare parts. ram wise good.. but cam quality is not so good network problem.. this is best smartphone at this price. i\\'m very happy to bought this phone. i personally strong recommend to any other just go for it. battery is very poor quality. its 4000mah battery but draining very fast. camera quality also very poor. good phone with awesome specifications nice features.. can purchase parfons faster and godloking not

phone / phone is not good totally wastage of money.. loved it sound and video effect good. but battery capacity average. less features as compared to vibe series hand set heating problem ,how to

company is doin nothing for this.worst phone ever used. good but just the speaker given is only on one side. it should have been given on both sides just like lenovo k4 i have been using it for the past 15 days ever since it was launched. the mobile is really good much faster than my earlier lenovo k4 note super battery life vest of money .. battery very low camera quality very low lenovo product pls not buy frds heats fast and battery discharges fast...too fast.so i think should be improved. pros.better display in price rangeandroid nougatsolid build qualitydedicated slots for sim and

over all good buy. it is not gorilla glass my new phone got scratch. still it has scratches on on my screen,how come they said its gorilla glass.its a fake description....!!! it has several good features, worth the cost of product. its an great device for what you are paying!!performance is top notch!only black bezels irritated me!but the whole look of the device is premium! ❤️ camera not better it\\'s been just 20days of having this mobile and suddenly ear speaker stopped working... excellent phone good battery life,good camera and not much heating problem long battery, selfie flash, nicely designed.griped blue tooth and wifi problem. that it\\'s manufacturing or design fault.other things are good nice phone.... very nice features.. like ti a lot very good product!!performance is very good.i love this mobile. i buy lenovo k8 note it\\'s good ! but nfc was miss if it\\'s was added it\\'s great no other smartphone......!!!!! thank you amazon battery standing only for 8 hrs.how can clear this problem worst back camera clarity product is very goodbut feels that phone geeting hot sometimes .......as this is still not one month old this should not happen ......let\\'s see ....if company can review this issue everything is good as expected except the play back volume which is too low, especially when connected to external speakers. camera stands at average. so this mobile is good but while playing the games the display is fluctuating .... good best product of lenovo phone is much faster and good good i didn\\'t get second turbo charger in box .... overall it\\'s good but battery backup is issue. it gives 12 hr backup. rest is good. best in this price. heating is only aproblem it has very good performance at work without complain. it is very chief to compare any other mobile really pissed off with the product. this is the first product i bought from amazon not even 2 months the phone is switching off automatically not responding at tyms ..apps suddenly stops working etc. bought mobiles from flipkart earlier still no issues working perfectly fine. extremely disheartening with the product delivered by amazon. phone is lagging frequently very very poor product. moved from moto to lenovo for first time and surely, this will be the last time. the specs are just highlighted but the phone is half as good as the phones with lower specs. very disappointing. the phone was working great until it was running on android 8. lenovo published an update from android 8 to 9. after the update the phone is near to useless. i have to full charge it 3 times in a day. the battery is draining too quickly and the turbo charger has stopped working. due to heavy cpu usage after the update the phone is always heating. i upgraded the os in may and started getting the issues. i went to service center and they presented with only one solution, that is to wait until a software update arrives. it has been two months and i have still not received any update.if you are planning to buy this phone then please refrain from upgrading it to oreo. otherwise this phone is good. i got this product from amazon but unfortunately the charger is not working. i wish if it can be replaced. im still using a lenovo k5 note i find audio speakers better than this k8 note,only on this basis im not fully satisfied with this k8 note.on the other hand k8 note is really a killer phone as they said at this price point it\\'s really a best buy 4gigs of ram n 64gigs of internal dedicated and card slot that means you can use 2 sims n sd card both that\\'s what i like about this k8 note.over all its a best buy,but im not fully satisfied with the audio quality as of k5 notes speakers we can really feel the real bass in some heavy bass songs.anyway thanks lenovo ® for this amazing phonei ✌️❤️ lenovo ® very worst... heating issue third class phone , hanged every time , i replaced two times. bluetooth is not working properly. below par bulky phone with ordinary display.the camera is just not that good.i do not know why was there a need for dual camera.not recommended for photography lovers. nice performance i have not satisfy this,,.bcz reciver voice breaked and not clearly hearing ,and also can\\'t show camera images in gallery ..purchased in 01_04_2018....i can\\'t returned also,...compliant arrives at after the returned time very good. really excellent phone with all good connectivity no problems with battery ,dolby atmos is really good it also has an option in the main index to on it or off .before i bought this product some reviews showed a problem in connectivity to internet and jio ,there is no such problems this new launched beast is really good with all handy and cool feautures, camera is good and expecting for further updates related to depth mode .finally it is a really very good product under 14k.no heating issues so far and with in 2 hrs battery goes from 0 to 100 while charging,, on a heavy use this phone gives 8 hrs of full use. good awesome mobile...no heatingbudget mobile ..no hang ..nice camera front flash nd back camera ...my best choice mobile...all in one product really nice... front camera is not so good ( improvement need)depth mode is not proper working (improvement need )sound qty is no so gooda mob has 4 gb performance is goodno auto call recorder is support to this phone ( improvement need)in build call recorder should be available earlier the phone was working fine. but from last 4-5 days some apps are taking long time to open. even internal phone contact list is also taking time to open. when you search any contact in the directory, it is taking time to display results. not sure what it is going on. would request amazon team if they can look into the issue and resolve. ye bahut kharab mobile h, mujhe abhi 12 din hue h isko liye hue abhi se yah over heating ho raha h or automatically restart ho jata h, or shutdown ho jata h or khabi to battery charging 6-7 hrs me bhi nahi ho raha h or ye problem me amazon ko bata kar product return kar raha hu to amazon wale kahte h lenevo care me bat karoye mobile kharab h or even amazon site to bahut jyada kharab h automatically getting heat with using mobile.... excellent phone. superfast charging. great camera. it can run fast... battery is good .... camera quality avarage.. overall nice phone.. this phone really is a killer, it will kill you with frustration.1.constant heating during game play/call/ or video.2. battery drains very fast, even handsets with 3000mah battery lasts longer than this phone.3. picture quality gets lower in depth mode.4. networks goes to \\'no service\\' mode very frequently. once the network is gone, the only way to get connected is to restart.5. signal strength is less, compared with other device at the same place.6. during the low battery the performance is really slow, a normal news app opens up 2-3 sec after tapping.7. charging is really slow, charges only 30-40% in an hour. super no connectivity with miracast or any other casting device other than chromecast. no icon notification for unread messages & mails. no downloading of pdf attachment as it says there\\'s virus and many more issues. i don\\'t know who will take care of of these? phone restart again and again nice best phone with the best price for a person poor battery backup this product is very bad display.camera not good.speed superb.function it\\'s very bad from other device 1.takes 4 hours to charge,also battery drains fast.(charging just trough usb in pc,just forget about it,with usb connected for charging battery drains dono why.)2.slow booting up with senseless graphics while mobile is turning on.3.can\\'t lock apps with finger print or password/pattern.4.camera is not up to the mark,and the dual camera option is stupid.5.hardware is awesome just needs tweaking around in the software department.6.phone slips a lot with the backcover which is provided in the box.i broke 2 temper glass in just 15days on purchasing the mobile.7.navigation keys are not illuminated with light,difficult to use in the dark until you get used to it.8.network reception is very weak,slow data speeds are common.9.wifi and bluetooth gets automatically turned off every now and then.10.auto brightness is not good,cant use mobile in sun with auto brightness set.(brightness does not adapt properly.)there you go thats my honest review.after exchanging my redmi note 3 to lenovo k8 note. good phone. very bad phone.. heng very badlly.. call log heng every time.. i suggest to buyer not purchase this lenvo k8 note.. my money is best totally.. battery backup is not good. finger sensor performance is poor. this phone is good but this phone will not give u that features which r in other phones.in this phone amazon is saying that u will get a new system update but in some lenovo k8 note it takes long time to get the new system update. getting heated very fast and battery drains fast one word : awesome display is very poor not gorilla glass sound is poor primary camera is poormy display is damaged no camera picture quality.signal problem when it operates in dual sim mode. k8 is decent but battery backup is not upto mark as it has 4000 mah battery.it can last a day with moderate to heavy usage. like inspite of there being a tmprd glss also it\\'s display broke into pieces in it\\'s first fall only...and cant evn find a perfect tmpered glass for it .. this product is very good, and good camera quality, battery backup is also very good, and it\\'s working fine with an good internal memory and ram, really i like this product. nice handset good battery backup got k8 and not as expected product. phone heats up battery is draining @5% per 3 min of usage. amazon is not taking responsibility to exchange it pretty good phone, backed up with lot of featured. no issues till now. best part i liked about this phone is fingerprint sensor at the backside. its a good phone overall...however it\\'s not volte enabled which made me disappointed..the battery backup is also not so good as per my expectations thnxx.. love it. came on time with 1 day delivery. also came equipped with a back phone cover which was a relief. performance is outstanding..camera is just amazing. so many options in the camera. storage is great as well. go for it since it is an amazing budget phone.. very bad mobile ...dont buy it not at all satisfied ...very heavy value for money. heating issue, application is not working, very bad experience. please do not buy the product and do

ok that there should be a delay but this lenovo k8 note is taking morethan 10 seconds to open just the call history or the call log. worstest cheap and unuseful mobile i have ever seen. a worst product. users should not buy this at all. no proper functioning, poor touch, poor features, video quality is just worst. you will regret buying this product. 000000000.zero mark after oreo update... battery backup is in worst condition camera is good but not so if we talk about dual cameraphone size is very large dolby atmos sound is goodbut it takes so much time to turn on if u turn it of wonderful phone a value phone.....in this range.simply a great phone. good phone but some times network and intarnet problemcamera result is also good it\\'s a nice phone. loved it.. new phone lenovo k8 note is not working. i want either its replacement or return money. worst phone ever used good very very very nice and beautiful phone. i like it i am big lenovo fan but this phone has put its reputation down. serious heating issues and no solutions. i won\\'t recommend very good...... i purchased this phone on 20 march 2018. i was hoping to that it would be killer phone. it has quite good specifications too. but i can say, this is feature less phone. superb phone... and i am enjoying it... phone works great. sound is good, camera works great but takes time sometimes to autofocus, fingerprint sensor works fine and battery backup is up to the mark , great phone in this range, asphalt 8, mortal combat 5 , dead trigger 2 works without any single lag till date, gaming performance to battery consumption is quute good, dwpth mode needs to be a bit better but it\\'s acceptable at this range. the worst phone in the world i was expected good sound,because i love listening but it disappointed me.earphone sound worst. verry bade battry power this phone is having hanging issues since 2nd day of its use. unable to restart and it gets warm even watching videos and turbo charging is not working properly. battery gets low quickly. very very disappointed by this phone. pls don\\'t buy this phone. worst experience ever. best phone in this range love it!! dont buy this cell phone..no inbuilt call recording even third party app is not supportedno i built voice recorderscreen remained blacked out even when u pushed it away from earworst product by lenovo the phone\\'s performance is good . doesn\\'t hang at all. but the battery life is not up to the mark,doesn\\'t even last a full.day vest nice phone.selfie expert. awesome very good product,delivered quickly camera is worst and this vendor give worst quality product. not great bt it\\'s quite ok .. you have a better option on this price depth mode is a crap... takes almost 2 mins to boot up.. speaker quality is poor than k5 note... battery doesnt retain as 4000mah good feel phone is good, but if you are unlucky as i was as the screen of my phone was broken due to which i had to visit there service centre in delhi , then you are in big sit.first of all they don\\'t have screen in there stock & on top of that they are asking exorbitant 7500 rs for screen change for a mobile phone which is only 14000 rs.i will suggest everybody that if you are buying lenovo products specially mobile then buy with your own risk & once you brought their product they are least bothered about their customers. amazingly fast delivery.... about the phone, it is one of the best among the <15000 price range and provide best feature s in the category amazon and lenovo is cheating customers. only one sim support 4 g network. i am using airtel and jio sim when i use airtel for data then jio sim lost his network because it support only 4g ok.p processing realy fast enough but nothing like turbo charging. charging slow & battery backup poor. cast screen not working at all. nice phonefront camera is goodbattery good everything good,but back duel camera very bad .it is cheating.only one camera working.top camera is not working.left side speaker not working. received today. phone working as per expdctation. supports jio sim. rest all superb nice product,got delivery on time from amazon. nice work! fully

battery with turbo fast charging!i bet no phone can beat this king in this price, these specifications, and build quality!#savage! cast is not working wonderful mobile with unique features battery performance quality is poor. mobile so bundlebattery problemscharging problem many problems connecting problems is the most not user friendly this lenovo k8 note, finding very difficult to access any good networks, it hangs ,even to connect to voice calls or browsing any preloaded apps eg.. . google store..i have used several branded mobiles . though it has 4g ram but its processing is very slow compare to any other mobile having 1g ram ,which i have experienced . not happy in overall , before purching this model i assumed this was good set .. i request the manufacturer to look into this matter seriously to solve issues.even dueal camera results not upto the mark.see below some of the photos taken from this mobile both dueal camera normal and depth photo shots. camera problem alarm no sound ring tone sum time no sound worth to rate.. process very nice.. mobile is very slow,while charging it gets to hot,i request to replace by new one already one serviced it is not updating ..... ,, good for the cost. this product is very bad damn second camera is not working n battery backup is bad. advertisement was awesome but the product was not up to the expectation it feels so disappointed. not up to the mark and even if i want to return with in time, ama, on foes not permit. it refers to technical centre which checks the product and says product is ok and you can not do anything further. the photos taken give a blue tinge. pure chinese look....doesn\\'t seems premium at all...just a phone to highlight the features...but actually its not giving any thing excellent performance it is nice ph faulty product amazing heating problem amazing problem : 1) dual nano sim with dual-standby (4g+4g) only single sim 4g network support , dual 4g sim not work .. 2) both camera performance is very very bad .3) battery not turbo charg & sound issue. phone is not working properly not properly working henge ho raha h bakwas product screen cast doesn\\'t work with smart tv, it works only with chromecast. too bad.this is because it\\'s stock android. lenovo k8 note performance is goodcamera perfect but battery is very bad.the low quality gorilla glass protection the phone is good, battery is long lasting, charges fast, gives good performance. the phone heats a little while charging and the dual camera is of no use. normal photos are good but the depth effect is very bad. so, if you want potrait mode don\\'t go for this phone. however, if you don\\'t care about potrait mode and need a normal camera, this phone is great. it is mentioned on website that box will contain headset along with charger. but headset is missing. motherboard get damaged in four months. second sim slot not detecting always. happens with all type of sim ok. so far so good. i strongly recommend that do not buy this phone. it has issue of bettery draining and charging. it gets to much time to charge. the transparent back case was fully scratched one. it\\'s super excellent thank you for amazon super battery charging fast handling excellent quality good network issue best one in specs in this price range. gifted this to my mom on her birthday....its total 100% value for your money....works smoothly,takes awesome pics,decent battery life,doesnt hang!best phone at the cost which it comes beating many other priced around 19k-20k...excellent phone! good lenovo k8 note it\\'s

experience.. camera is really good for sellfies.. one of the best mob for photography 4g network not working and network also fluctuate during data is on. average. beat thing is fast charge and good battery life... everything else is average... reception quality poor seal was not broken though it looked like someone has tried to open it.back cover was scratched.the battery was completely discharged which should not be the case.there were two alarms already saved in the phone as if someone else was trying to use the phone. pros:1) fantastic display and colour reproduction2) design and build quality3) above average secondary camera with selfie flash4) good ram management5) no heating issues felt till datecons:1) mediocre primary camera2) dedicated music button stopped working unexpectedly after the first day worst battery ever seen in my life... 20% drops in single night where mobile is not even touched. good value for money!! i got only 13 mp back camera no 5 plus camera earphones were not found in the package i was cheated purchase @ 13999flipcart rate was 10999 very very worst don\\'t buy this phone. it has battery draining and volte issuesinstead buy a redmi phone. one star is deducted because some features were not friendly like back button is at left side which is bit difficult to use for right hander there are so many common android fetures are missing wifi strength metre data download speed metre missing alarm not ringing in power off mode. there is nothing like tirbo charging it takes 2 hour 45 minutes to full charge. while charging in off mode it will not show pecentage done. wide touch option not there in pull down menu so many shortcuts are missing.dont buy it.average phone you will became fool it came as new piece .. but i had to reset again because all my files which i had transferred were there but not displaying means phone came as manufacturer defect. after reset it was working but lost all my data. battery is ok for a day . camera is good. play pause button should be assigned only for one purpose only. overall average to good phone it\\'s a great phone.. i liked very much in this mobile there is no auto call recording option. third party apps also not recording..only recording our voice.not able to recording others voice. other wise all specs are good..! everything is fine,but showing low network signals and little hot on charging. satisfying smartphone good smartphone for lower medium budget. is average in all departments. dual camera setup is just a gimmick and not at all useful. but the normal and front camera is decent. contains all sensors and nothing is skipped. only thing is that lenovo is bad with update pushes but till now has provided support. good for normal daily usages like surfing, video calls, social networking etc. good nice one..very satisfied i bought a lenovo k8 venom black model just one day before. i have started using it but i\\'m not satisfied with the delivered product. i\\'m facing few issues. like, when the device gets locked automatically,i\\'m unable to unlock it using power key. since it\\'s a new product i would expect a quality substance but that was not there in my case. i request you to look into the issue to take back the device & provide a better solution. good i bought a phone at 12000 but this mobile is not work bad product many options are less network problem ok goodi am not recived cash back 1 star cut for bukeh mood worst expierence in my life heavy haeted and no charging heavy in wieght.camera,music are good.but look is average. this mobile is 🔥 heating too much... double camera quality is not good.. front camera is good for selfie lover...i think it name should be k8 🔥 fire ..... becoz it gives u nothing but heat... sombody plzzzz help me to resolve this issue...and friend i suggest you..honor 6x is far better than this heating element... just network problem i will. face on sim one slate.. mobile is undoubtedly best in its sector but unfortunately my mobile front camera has stopped working due to which i am not fully satisfied and convinced about buying a product from online stores. the company is requested to kindly get my mobile replaced. third class camera lenovo fools banavo mat bogas which is better honor 6x or lenovo k8 note phone is superb but somewhere i found heating issues,specially while charging,and also the dual rear camera combination is not so special,front is good,else everything is excellent. good very bad item, so many heating problem, depth are not like dslr, so many problems in this phone don\\'t buy it\\'s heating and battery fast draining fix this pleased too much heating, u can actually iron your shirt so much heat is produced and apps not responding properly. i would give a negative rating if it was been there other than camera nothing it has good...neither it has any latest advanced feature added in its system software..for each basic purpose you need to install a separate app like app lock.also don\\'t have basic features like reading mode& other advanced settings. i have complain with your phone body design & software system i think it looks like older model also it\\'s software.no improvement most bad technologies phone in world..1st thing it\\'s heated more and more with normal use.no games ,no wifi..if use wifi then it heated very much.dont buy this phone.i want to sell my phone on 6k.used 6mnth. friends dont go for lenova k8 note its totally waste of money.bcoz with 15 days of usage experience its waste . liked it... awesomeness no call recording possible, call records only for last 3 calls...bakwaas phone... set is ok. but since i used lenovo k3 note, i think features are more with lenovo k3 note and quality of camera much better with k3 note compare to k8 note. phone call recording system also not available with k8 note which was very much there with k3 note. please don\\'t buy this product.... battery is over heating like anything...and overall i will give rating of 2 only.you will get good smartphone if you add 3000 extra.pls go for that.also don\\'t ever buy phone from amazon since you cannot return the product if it\\'s damaged or not working.i am a victim...they will ask to download an app and then after getting through some steps, finally they will tell you that your phone is working properly.... this one is the best photo in this range. i am happy with this photo. thanks as shown in ad it\\'s not a killer, cameras are not up to the mark. only two things are great one is touch pad and finger sensor. all major applications are belongs to google only. lenovo doesn\\'t own any app, not any music player themes, wallpaper, not even set our own ringtone. very good phone lenovo k8 note does not have screen mirroring option. you cannot connect to your smart tv.but that option is available in k4 note and k5 note and in many lenovo models.advance model means extra features should get added not removing the existing features. worth to buy..., but the screen have low resistance good battery got heat, wanna to change what the procedure if there could be 0 star, i will give that...!!battery is discharging very rapidly as if it is of 500 mah battery...!! good best smartphone using this for a month. good camera, screen. very good product good one.... good product , worth for money everything is ok but not support dual sim 4g. only one slot supprot 4g mobile heated and hangle otherwise good this phones interface is soo bad a nice mobile. only auto call recorder is a deficiency. excellent purchase heating problem..have any solution?? should i return? pathetic signal reception issue. this in turns drains battery very quickly awesome phone it\\'s good to have all new features in this but the battery backup was not very goodand heating very quickly and remaining all are very nice lenovo have launched this handset with several features but all are waste. the phone will start heating, hanging, charging issue, network issue after 4 months itself. i loved lenovo k3 note and that\\'s why purchased it due to feature like dual rear camera & deca processor. totally waste to buy. never ever go for it. even the service is also too bad.don\\'t update to oreo, the handset is dead. the product has arrived n tim.. good service.. the mobile deserves 5rating. all the nee features added n t. but d android version nougut s not gud network problem it\\'s my honest review i\\'ll really enjoy with this phone its price range just go for it very good product in this range and this type of functions ... wonderful product only one bad point,music sound quality is not good. nice.. good and timely delivery by amazon.overall a good smartphone.but the camera could have been betterspecially in low/dim light conditions nice mobile not recommended product. working fine for one week but now its not working. super performance 😍😍 poor very poor performance it heat immediately & drain the battery in 2-3 hrs the usb cable size is too small, it has almost no use. cameras both rear and front are soso. box is without ear phone. good device, no issues of the prod. no heating as iam a moderate user and don\\'t play games. super smooth touch.jio comfortably configured. good device for the price. i have purchased this phone in first time in amozen but very bad experience i received defective charger but no body help me best product prosgood mobilegood performancegood packing and deliverypersonally i like this mobile.camera and sound clarity is good.cons1 mobile heating up while charging.2 display edges are curved, so air bubbles are there on tempered glass edges.3 i took venom black, flet something is missing in appearance.cant pin point. better go for white.4 if u r buying,better buy its accessories like pouch, tempered glass or scratch guard.u cant find these items in local store.5 no earphone with this set.6 (most important) mobile is heated up by prolonged use of wifi. don\\'t buy this.... it is not giving proper network. maximum time mobile hang while talking. battery does not work for a long time. poor gorilla glass 3 it\\'s easy damaged in my pocket and when i asked to them so they said they are not responsible for damage. so why the addverties that product is very good and have good qualities....raj mishra7383506358 please go for mi a1st it\\'s the best, far better than the k8 i want invoice charging is slow. cam is excellent. good phone. when it get updated to oreo it get heated and start some unwanted activities. overall it\\'s a good product..very handy.battery backup very good with turbocharger..camera average..nice fingerprint scanner..overall its a best device under 15k. when there will be a new update for this phone because the phone rear camera depth mode is not nice and the phone is getting heat and the battery life is not nice. average phone.. dual camera and depth mode are over rated. not that good.go for moto. though its owned by lenovo itself, still the performance is better. received the defective piece.... mobile is good but heting problem with drain fast discharge battery. battery back up problem. after oreo update phone has battery draining fast,can turn off mobile data no heating issues found. product received in two days time. mobile performance is fantastic. turbo charging is good. charged my phone battery from 24% to 100% in 1hr 10mins time. will definitely recommend this product. but if you can spend 3k bugs extra moto g5s plus will be a better option... screen is very weak it is not gorilla glass so be careful when buying it phone getting charging 6 hr for 60% , getting heat , and i think it is not new mobile ,i want replacement because it\\'s is old mobile it doesn\\'t have atleast transparent pouch heating issue (it heat alot and might this issue lead it to blast & might hurt any one or urself. will not recommended it even i return it) also camara quality is not upto the mark.. in 1 month, i have issue with unlocking key pad is missing so no pin can be entered, still figuring how to rectify this issue please do not buy this phone.worst phone ever seen selfie camera totally mirror reflection type reverse words in photo and battery is 4000mah fast charging 2 hours more than over heating 2-3 battery stand back dual camera is very bad depth camera not and dolby speakers not working properly and phone refurbished lenovo zuk 2 . excellent i m totally dissatisfied and disapointed as i didn\\'t expect this kind of phone. i have purchased this mobile on 25-8-17 and after some days only i felt that i m being cheated as there are no features of smart phones , smart features in call history are completely missing,phone doesn\\'t allow me to do a conferene call,at the bottom there are shown dual speakers but one sided speakers are fully dead just like a show piece, there is a 4 gb ram specification but for the daily use apps counted only 3 named watsapp ,hike , true caller it consumes average of 3 gb ram so it is only a fool making option.hated lenovo mobiles from this purchase onwards. feeling cheated good paradoxically great phone but some features like power - power manager - and shortcuts for silencing the phone and others are not there - which we can use very often good...it\\'s working smoothly..and also thanks to amazon to deliver it within time... very worst product. charging slot is not working. it hardly takes charging. i am unable to charge my phone. it\\'s a bad mobile camera and sound quality is very poor the product is good but but the phone is heating if talk 20-25 minutes and amazon delivery is very bad. good mobile k8 note very fast charge with turbo power is given but sim number is not show and not save any number in sim card because stock android is given camera not satisfied. nice phone but kuch missing hai battery back up is killer, camera is just too good, bokeh mode is very. good quiet effective,slow motion video is also quiet great to capture.dolby is amazing ..looks also super venom black...charging if it could have been made a lil quicker but no complaints very good in this price... best modal for lenovo great good built... i am not totally satisfied. just average awesome phone , battery backup is very nice ,camera is also gud and sound system is better because of dolby atmos... where the hell is super power saver feature like k3 note phone??? brought this on great indian sale ..sound quality is worst ..have to volume up min 5 times for the sound to raise to 1 point ..and max sound is very less...dolby does not have any effect as compared to other lenovo mobiles..screen brightness is very poor .. dont buy this, this mobile automatically switches off when battery charges full battery 3rd class.number 1 hang mobile.mobile heating highly battery is not working 12 haour and camera results is evrage nice product good one this phone is really awesome and super cool ; i have been using for a month and it\\'s performance is excellent better,,not bad battery back up is not up to the mark, getting too much heating, the rest are good. bugs to be automatically fixed superb camera, battery and performance it is a very nice phone worst mobile i have ever purchased overall a good phone but battery backup is not good and phone must have different colours for led light for different notifications. super.. awesome . it performs very much better than the replaced one . no heating problem during calls .battery draining is quite relevant. everything is ok but lenovo should have provided an earphone. admirable camera calrity and best selfie phone .worth buying for this cost . this is absolutely amazing cell worst product, returning back......display flickering.....horizontal lines fluctuating on keypad.... very good. the cons are as follows:1.battery does not last more than 8 hours with typical usage. a toy in front of redmi note 4.2. terrible performance of both front and rear camera in low and transient lighting condition. focussing barely happens. even if it does, it takes 2-3 seconds and get lost.3. depth mode is a joke. it blurrs the hair if you try to focus on the face. awsome product by lenovo....excellent competition in market very bad phone the user interface is so bad waht to tell and worst part amazon won\\'t takenit back purchaseing a phone from amazon is a trap plz dnt not worth full the system update is too bad, everyday there will be new software to update, and everytime i update my phone gets slower.the battery is draining fast, and charge takes time.the phone switches off itself sometimes.it takes 4 to 5 minute to switch on. nice phone, so fast and hassall free.... perfect ! battery is not up to it\\'s capacity superb..... it\\'s not water resistant this phone problem.... soreturn..plzzz flipkart is giving at rs.11,000/- charger probalem after 5 days from i bought it....it works good .everything is perfect ok... camera and battery are not upto the marked remaining every thing is perfect,heating issue is there but i assume due to its deca core processors and aluminium body it\\'s been little warm..but battery is an big issue..need optimization ..i believe lenovo will surely release and ota update to enhance the performance simply great awesome phone, great looks great battery backup, turbo changing is so gud it charge 100% battery in 80 min onlycamera & dollby automus audio is also gudvalue for money phone... good phone just feeling top of the world product is good.we need to inset the headphone in mobile jack until we hear a tip sound. else we might be under the impression that headphone is not compatible with mobile.jbl,samsung headphone suits with thislenovo k8 note.its a great mobile for the prize range. notification problem, left side speaker problem,app hanged ,otherthan this this phone is good very good in performance, sound & picture quality. note true note good product worth for the money it\\'s worth for the cost.. weak on network signal. dismal good phone thankyou amazone voice issue found and go to lenovo care to solve at 1st day . nice phone pls pls pls go for lenovoall camera n specifications & all r best performance also look so better .... it is better very poor performancemany times reboot automatically in a dayservices and apps are auto stopped. update: from the past few days my k8 note is taking more than 8 hours to charge. i am using the original charger that shipped with this phone. the turbo charging has stopped. lenovo will ask to carry it to their service center. too frustrating.the phone is fast due to the ram and processor. however, none of the lenovo phones have a good camera. i wish i had again bought the honor6x which i use for myself, as the lenovo was a gift to someone. i bought it considering the dual camera feature but this is nowhere close to the camera quality that honor 6x provides.- the photos are not clear and are grainy.- the camera app does not have filter modes like night-mode, beauty mode, slow motion for video.- however, the phone is not bulky and has a gorilla glass. the back cover is a good add-on.- the battery optimisation feature is not that effective.- badge count for apps (whatsapp unread count on icon) is not available.- navigation keys are not illuminated.i would advice honor6x in case people are looking for a quality camera phone. the pro model is also good if people are willing to shell out more. it is a pathetic phone. poor display... battery draining fast and heats up too much while charging...and looks ordinary...fast fp scanner and processor.. item not so good as i expected. charge drains fast. & not seems like charged with turbo charging. model is not so good. but sound quality is best i\\'ve ever seen in a phone. finger print sensor is best. too angry that not contain earphone in the box. camera quality is very bad ,batery performance is quite disappointed, no led notification for miss calls. bed 🔋 backup, front camera quality is poor in night,overall average rated mobile very soon heating problem. don\\'t ever never buy this. for more details feel free to call me on 9852865839 unsatisfied with lenovo k8 note 64. battery consumption is high, can be drained in less than 6 hrs with continuous working on phone, turbo charge is not right as you said in just minutes. it take one and half hour to get charged. rear camera is very bad at night , screen resolution is pale, 5star it is worst phone, amazon does\\'nt return tis product. battery is overheating. i suggest please nobody buy this lenovo k8 note... speaker/mike not working, screen mirroring not working, contacts diretly saving to google account. it has no inbuilt photo gallery, music player, video player. the phone does not meet required standards at certain fields. it\\'s seems google is virtually in control of the phone. good very nice product good to use i love it the mobile gets heated with one hr of normal use.system apps use more space in ram.unable to connect to computer for file sharing/transfer.. not worth for the money.battery good.camera ok camera picture and video quality poor is mobile me sab accha h lekin camera bilkul bekr h second camera kisi kaam ka nhi kuch nhi hota over all gud speed mobile .. purchased a new lenovo k8 note from amazon site one month back..but very much disappointed nd disturbed as opted for it thinking a product of renowned co.getting a lot of trouble ..will never suggest anybody to buy a lenovo product...also went to lenovo service centre ..they told it\\'s a motherboard problem...will take 15 days for repair...very very bad product nd service from lenov0 & amazon..cheating people with selling defective product...9833228989 - deepak has heating issue alot. the heats alot during game and browsing. i have replaced the phone bcs of this and later the replaced phone also has same problem so finally i have returned the phone . nice job worst ever phone by lenovono proper bluetoothvery long battery charging timeover heating problemheavy in weight it has many issues with calling , volte support , and returning , so i truly advice to not to buy this device. phone is good.processor is much better,sound quality is good,camera quality good,but i m not received with headsetearphone and tempered glass.if you buying this type coastly phone so you have deserve this acceserie ...better is fastly drained if i m continue use internet... 1) heating issue2) notification lead works only when fone being charged.3) takes 4+ hrs to charge4) battery drains quickly, lenovo k8 drains faster then samsung on nxt which has 3.3k battery backup.5) if you download hd videos then to it displays very poorly.6) downloading on this phone is disaster even with the best of 4g network.7) camera quality not that great as quoted. depth mode sucks.8) the worst part there\\'s no gallery in this phone so all your photos/videos end up in google storage which is limited to 15gb including emails.8) non lit keys.9) only 1 speaker which on bottom10) like old motorola handset iske key bhi ulte hai..where on phones back key was on right on lenovo k8 it\\'s on left so it\\'s quite irritating bcoz that\\'s not what you see on any android fones good in camera.and fast charging, working smooth i love it happy with the purchase and fast delivery product is good. battery performance is not like redmi 4000 mah battery. overall good mobile. ear phone missing.... not upto the mark.. very poor battery and performance.since day one so many inbuilt apps are not working properly majorly contacts!! the moment 2 apps were downloaded the phone started hanging. its still hanging. since day1 the battery s extremely poor. my 1.5 year old mi note 3 phone had a muchbetter back up than this new lenovo phone. the software has a very poor performance. not supporting many things. wifi from phone doesn\\'t connect to the wifi. using basic contacts and calling is also a task. basic feature of call recording missing. no indication for forwarded calls. 2 days back created problem with whatsapp as well and suddenly my recent data disappeared. similarly many basic features are missing and is not useable. it heats up too often can lenovo/amazon help?? weight is high., while we are attending call ,so many windows are opening.,i think some software problems.,back button is on left side is not good good mobile for normal middle range got this amazing phone 4 days back, till now updated to it\\'s latest sw package, working fine, amazing photo\\'s quality, i have not tested it\\'s battery backup,yet, but seems satisfying till now. gr8 buy in this price range. good for selfie and camera mera cash back back kab tak aayega sir awesome very good product good features in this rate...its been 3months, i have been using this phone, performance is good, if you are looking for a cell phone with good features at this rate you can surely go for this one.. super not as presented. there is only dolby option button not the actual advantage. shiwn as if there are two speakers in bottom with speakers out holes actually like any china or iphone only single 🔊 works the second 🔊 is dummy. good product from lenovo. it is working as per my expectation. thanks lenovo. it\\'s awesome by it\\'s specifications. nice phone best mobileonly small heating issue it internet very very fast fast gorilla gorilla glass is a very good all around good product does meet as expectations and as written on websiteheating handset, camera quality ,battery no turbo

goodrecommended to buy i\\'m gifted to own this mobile. works fine. operation is easy. battery power is good. price is good. dislikeas it update has changed the phone into waste because due to update battery, heating, slow processing like problems has been occurred battery is poor. lenovo is not supplying quick charge to this handset. average performance phone with a higher price tag. no significant features in this handset gud phonegud battery backupmobile look so sexythank lenovo k8 this phone is lte not volte 😒camera is good but doesn\\'t focus properly the battery life is very poor. also the handset is get very heat when using....the handset is very bad front cam would have bit better quality, much disappointed after receiving the device. good value for money. battery back up not good its draining fast also turbo charging not working well some times i have screen shot as proof that it takes 3 hours to fully charge.plus point is camera ,music & processor speed.. awesome product but having some heat issue while charging which is naturally okay with turbo charging technology. camera is good but not upto the mark. please don\\'t buy this product. lot of customers are suffering from network issue and rear camera issue. most of people have raised the issues to lenovo but till date they haven\\'t fix the issues. i am disappointed after purchase this brand lenovo. i sold my nexus phone for this and it was my great mistake. beautiful phone. thank you flipkart. -prosfastconspoor quality camera. bought this phone for dual camera and nothing special about it.very poor battery. it drains in 12 hours with moderate useslittle bulkysmart gesture features missing. beautiful phone.... nice build quality, dual camera is decent,blur effect is not that good just say ok... front camera is good.. questioning myself why i didnt order it on the first day flash sale... totally worth the money... impressed with the amazing battery life... doesn\\'t heat up much compared to other lenovo models... amazon packing was appreciable as usual.disappointed for delivery time even paid prime member it took 6 day to arrive.i have been decided to purchase nokia6 then sudden launch of k8 , revert my decision ...so that bought this device .but after getting this device i am really very disappointed .*front and rear camera quality does decent job on daylight (but you need to hold camera after click 😑) but sucks in low light.no use of front and back flash both cause noisy image .*when try both front and rearcamera under room light omg very bad camera quality even you yuphoria 8mp camera beat it.*don\\'t know why lenovo fix dual camera in this device...3rd class depth of field (portrait mode)coolpad cool1 did better job.*i think snapdragon 430 of nokia will be slower than decacore mt x23... but realised why ppl not happy with media take procccessor :(it takes too much time to process image even holding it up after click.*battery does decent job 👍lasts upto 8 hrs, but charging was pathetic tooks more than 2.5 hr (when do not use phone)pros:-thank to nougat stock androidoleophobic ,coating ,2.5 d , corning gorilla glasslet\\'s see what lenovo will be doing? either kill the device or kill the bugs through ota. good phone mobile is good but one draw back in this mobile as \"screenshot button/option is not separate on screen\" compare with lenovo a6000 plus.i request to lenovo company please change it and update with that function in your all handset.& also all settings are complicated to handle or changes,camera,data,filemanager,etc. worst phone ever. hanngs like hell. bettey drains very fast . very cheap phone. dont buy it. total waste of money. i m regretting for gifting this to my wife. because its not at all usable good speaker one of its speaker is not working, certainly does not expected this from amazon network signal problem nice mobile working fine excellent, meeting all my needs of operating it. really good phone. touch is excellent .. i am using this mobile since last 10 days and would say, it\\'s simply superb. it does exactly what it promised. go for it. the wrost phone of note series. dolby atmos don\\'t work properly. battery drains so fast and sound quality is not well. very bad experience bad camera camera quality is very bad compare to k8 note (3gb ram) this one is better average product. network issues and dual cam is just gimic. i\\'m using this device from almost 2 months and i\\'m very disappointed with perform of the device. depth mode is worst, gaming experience is very bad because it gets slower just after few minutes of gameplay. lenovo is also not providing regular updates quality product. new look . excellent performance. charger is also very heavy duty, therefore saves charging time( today\\'s need) heating issue. sometimes gets so hot that becomes difficult to hold in hand i don\\'t like this phone best delivery and best mobile but not receive hadfone in box don\\'t buy it simply sayingit doesn\\'t have gallery, applock,voice recordersecondary camera is not working dual camera is only for show off depth mode not working the jio network is always half i like this mobile for belowing reason1-it has no hybrid sim slot.dual sim with dedicated sd card slot.2-deca (10) core processor3-nano coating4-dolby atoms music5-lot of sensor such as magnetic (compass), fingerprint mobile is very nice the volume button is bulging out. no call recorder support. not having basic feature of lenovo phones like call recording and screen shot editor and very low battry backup turbo charging feature is false this is the worst lenovo mobile i used battery draining fast during hotspot good best performence mobile under 15000 i bought it for my father. it has a very good screen. i want to have the same screen for my phone mobile received...42958 speaker got bad within a month..gets slow sometime. nice mobile superb 👌 smart phone but, they should improve on aperture camera performance , other thing extraordinary nice one and only cons is battery drain very fast and it\\'s real problem. because first phone i replaced but issue is same.else all are good.i suggest don\\'t go for it if u do internet all the time awesome build quality camera performance very disappointing..would have been much more better at this price range.. it\\'s very good device.good performance, camera is good. nice product worst and poor product, wastage of money no costumer care. only 1 or 2 cheater service center mostly rohini center not meet to the expectation return the product bad fingerprintbaker camera battery baker backuptotal money loss appliances failed to prove , that they r from lenovo house . vary good good good phone satisfied.but size is not comfortable. mobile is not charging properly. phone reviewappearance: 4/5 phone is good looking and hold is good. i personally preferred black though gold is good.performance : 3/5 i am not sure why lenovo doesn\\'t used spandragon 635 ,processors used by lenovo is ok it\\'s fast but not consistent legs come and app crashes but memory management is goodscreen : 3/5 it is highly recommended to use screenguard scratches can from key and coinscamera : 2/5 duel back camera of the phone is not so great, you were not able to find refined depth effects some time you find originality is missing but it is good in sunlight with larg area cover4/5 front is best for this budget range pics are quite clear ans crispverdict : phone is good for average use but if you are looking for something extra this shouldn\\'t be the choice for you one of the worst products. after updating android o suggested by lenovo, i am not able to use this product now. i am not bothered about this. i am just bothered that i am losing all my data. had very bad experience phone\\'s turbo charging wasn\\'t working, also voice and video quality is very pathetic. amazon processed return after running smarkcheck application. this is the best device in this range good service and excellent phone by lenovo nice mobile nice heating issue....after 7 months, not even charging fast. good one.. don\\'t buy lenovo k8 note worst mobile heavy heating issue this mobile pls don\\'t buy lenovo k 8 note good it\\'s a path breaking phone. with new features like music key, dual camera and pure android experience k8 note will not disappoint you. the only con is battery drainage while phone is idle. i\\'m expecting it to be fixed in the subsequent updates. it is excellent product. it come out through my expectations. its battery with turbo charging, camera, design are very nice. review after using the phone for 6 month. one of the worst product of lenovo. i guess lenovo itself has become worst now.4 gb ram - never felt like using 4 gb. no ram management. phone slowed down in 6 monthscreen - all lenovo phone has screen issues. pale yellow mark automatically comes and screen wil be non responsive from that part.camera - worst camera even seen. even a 2000 rs phone might have better camcustomer carre support - worst ever.buy lenovo phones to waste your money. if you want a good phone with the speccs declared as in ad, then go for any brand but not for lenovo...my phone is in warrantee. called multiple times but they don\\'t bother abbt helping you. they just asked me to put my phone with lenovo support, it will be with them till they find any issues else thry will return it in a month or so. ( a month for finding issue in phone??)planning to throw the phone soon and bye bye to lenovo for ever. battery is not satisfied with its backupon my full charge at 6am, it exhausts around 2 pm battery backup poor.features are good.front cam good.rear cam poor.sametimes hanging problem.looking also good.overall satisfactory product notofication light are missing :( not excellent. used this mobile for 7 days.... flawless performance..for a normal user it last more than a day ...both camera is doing great in daylight but average in low light condition...gps is very bad not accurate.... battery is draining even when phone is not used.... camera in depth mode is not good...display is good.. there is no lag during gaming.... how to get a service for this and also warranty because my phone is hanging up and battery was getting down very fastly now a days awesome mobile and best budget smartphone and amazing deca core processor and splash proof its a awsome smart phone... heating issue, sim slot one have incoming calls & outgoing calls connectivity problems. battery is over heating best performance but speakers only one side so kindly check and buying.. this gudet very bad camera ok good product best performance very worst product, very worst customer service very good performance. budgeted phone.. all ok but display quality not good average. good qualities lenovo k8 note phonei like u it\\'s just an amazing phoneit has only one cons i. eit gets warm up quicklybut an ama phone i had purchased this mobile and returned on next day after observing the reviews from other users on amazon. let me brief you on the details:1. i liked this phone from the day when i saw its ad on amazon, look and feature were awesome.2. camera great, front is also great.3. no need to doubt on sound there is dolby atmos which is a plus point of the phone.4. on first time charging and video playing and games, it gets warmed a bit but that\\'s too because i was suspecting as mentioned on reviews ....it\\'s a normal heat nothing you can say as a negative point.5. no lagging6. only concerns are:a) battery draining is not usual. without use also charging% gets decrease. for example: in 4 hours after a full charge got discharge up to 22%. i had played a 5 minutes video and played 2 games for 5- 7 minutes only.may be this is due to processor as power management is not proper.b) network signal is not showing with full bar. however it was not impacting call performance or data performance.sometimes there won\\'t be a single bar of network but if you dial a number or try to open google....call will get connected and signal will appear on phone or google will work without any issue.if lenovo fix the problem by updates for battery draining and signal then this is definetly a great buy.unfortunately i had to return this phone as there is no solution at present.finally a great appreciation for amazon representative who did a health check of my phone and initiated a return.now time to check my account for the refund amount.😋 your product is good quality so thank you front panel gets too hot with even normal usage. it\\'s back panel always feels warm and after few minutes of usage i cant even make call because it gets too hot for my ear to bear. what is the use of other cool things which we can do with this device if we can\\'t perform the most basic function of calling ( without feeling the heat), browsing etc. the device always feels warm in your hand and a simple 10 mins of browsing and then you cant hold it against your ear to make a call,yes, it gets this hot. best phone in best price i love this phone, has everything, speakers are not loud and nothing fancy, lot of space and memory, only thing that was slow was google assistant. lenovo k8 note very good mobile....very good battery backup.....very good both camera quality ..... waste product dont go with lenovo or someother company only go with xaiomi and samsung phones nice mobile recording not available good phone with good features.. so far no issues it was good in process but not good in operating system it\\'s been 20 days since i am using this phone. great performance. but don\\'t look for this as a camera phone and yes it is bit heavy but that\\'s okay. fingerprint works smooth and fast, speakers are awesome, dolby sound is a plus, 4 gb ram makes it super smooth and fast,screen display is perfect with actual colors, go for it at rs 12,000/- (discount price). time to se how long it lasts. bought for ma dad he loved it worst thing i have ever got from amazon. this was my first order and i\\'m really disappointed from this product. good phone but camera not works good in low light, also it\\'s using 2.5 mb ram with pre installed apps. amazon both offer as idea 343 is can\\'t utilised because idea best offers are not showing it, as i have added motorola sports headphone also but it\\'s shown at not available in stock. at now it\\'s cost is 1599.00, in phone box there is no any headphone , so amazon is making fool in both offers amazzing phone good phone doesn\\'t come with new system updates as claimed in the description. i had to download and install 4 system updates. even though it was not much of a trouble, still that\\'s cheating the customer with wrong claims and is not acceptable. review of the product will be put up soon. battery very poor i am very unhappy very good phone & i love look ,design,& processer of this phone i have been using this phone for about 8 months phone is awesome eveythings fine a little bit work om camera nit such good camera over all phone is good horrible product.1st one had network reception problem.replacement had the same along with additional speaker problem.kudos to amazon team for assisting in hassle free refund of sum paid. it works like an costliest induction stove when i use more than 15 minutes. network signal strength very. worst. please give money to orphanage or other social networks instead of buying this worst and waste mobile. this mobile surely ruins amazon\\'s reputation. so amazon don\\'t promote this mobile. heating problem..hotspot not working..as per price camera is ok.. don\\'t buy pretty good a very product in lenovo k8note .... cons: pathetic dual camera, heats rapidly, no fast charging, application crashes, heavy weight. battery drains fast, bad network reception.pros: solid body, not so good display, smooth touch glass, i am satisfied with this product, but battery backup is average.... its too bad in mobile quality its a good product but as for frequent software updates. worst services by amazon till date. took a replacement of the device but then to the device won\\'t function properly... lagging a lot... worst battery life. would want to give a zero star butt they don\\'t have an option for it! bad battery awesome i\\'m very happy with the outlook but not the battery.battery drains very quickly and charging also very late. turbo charging feature is fully waste..os will consume more n more power than the external app like facebook, google maps.. i bought the lenovo k8 note on amazon. i\\'m deeply disappointed by the phone\\'s performance. the 4000 mah battery surprisingly lasts less than 24 hours even with minimal usage. the fingerprint scanner cannot recognize my finger print. the wifi feature gets disconnected after a couple of minutes even when the signal is strong. i\\'ve a feeling darshita electronics, the seller, has sold me a lemon! unfortunately, i cannot return the product as i started using after the date by which i could have returned it. nice products hello,the phone starts resetting itself randomly. this issue starts after after 3 days of use, especially when you use it for longer time like watching a you tube video for an hour or two. the issue starts to repeat after 1 or 2 days, then i tried few option mentioned in lenovo help app which is pre-installed(i am feeling like a stupid for having done this) , after that for 4 or 5 days it didn\\'t show this issue. now it back with a bang and almost resets itself every night. use the phone in night, then lock it and keep aside and when you take the phone again in the morning, boom, it is dead already. and when you manually power-on there is enough juice left in the battery. not sure what to do with this kind of issue, the phone is absolutely useless.when i approached amazon for return, they are quoting policy and suggest me that i should run pillar to post to get problem rectified (not sure even it is rectifiable issue), the below amazon\\'s tagline tag-line sounds funny\" earth\\'s most customer-centric company.\", i am not really sure whether they understood what they really mean, i am already started feeling bitter for my purchase decision in amazon and now i realized that buying lenovo brand is same as throwing your money into garbage. quality not so good.i want to return this item immediately.kindly processed as soon as possible. little bit heat excellent, worth of purchase totally wastage of money.even small features like network speed indicator,recorder is missing.clock hangs at any time.have to restart it again and again. this phone is the best, its camera is mind blowing, it\\'s touch is very soft, it\\'s battery backup is best battery life till 2 days , it is very easy to use. the best phone at this price range. its really an amazing product from lenovo. nice like cameradislike... heating n battery owsome mob abhitak soch kya rehe ho joldi lo i am glad to this nothing cons. thanks to amazon. all features are good..but battery is not as good as expected. i\\'m very disappointed with the battery life super but bettery performance is average to good overall phone is good small heat issue very good mobileandgood battery🔋fantastic camera📷 qualitygood speed its not as expected man camera quality bad in the box two chargers were committed but i received only one. mobile is not capable of pulling the network in the indoor very poor single i get in indoor. i have same lenovo p1m much better i have not faced single problem at least once but in k8 note once u switch off the data there will be nosignal on the phone. and there is no screenshot taking option in the phone. bekar fone good battery is not charging.. phone was working fine for 10 days but started heating now and battery takes more time to charge sold my flat to buy this.thank god just because of it i am never bore while begging on streets. good phone one of the best mobile, i used. worth of money all features are good with price. awesome phone with great ram performance.....it\\'s so cool no star for this!!!!!there is no any help from lenovo,i facing many problems such as1.we cannot attach contact in sms2. no call recording option....3.phone heating issue very higher level4.slow charging..and many more...... light not like average camera, dolby not working properly, have heating issue even with low usage and during charging, good battery charging where nic phone i ever use my phone is damaged .so how can claim the process? do not buy this phonewaist of money left speaker is not working due to which volume is less and not adequate.auto call recorder is not supportedinbuilt gallery app is not presentsharit app is not supported properly ordered for my cousin and received within 2 days thanks to amazon. stock android was the foremost reason to buy this mobile since stock android has benefits of smooth usage, relatively less load on cpu and better battery backup. but this mobile heats up for normal usage. forget gaming, it\\'s getting very hot for streaming on youtube. battery backup isn\\'t good because of over heating. camera is just okay. practically, redmi note 4 is much better and moto g5 plus is recommended. screen mirroring option not available.cannot cast mobile screen on smart tv.feature available in phones available with low features and configuration excellent please don\\'t buy this. k8 note has this serious issue of cellular data suspended. after a while, the data services on the sim card gets suspended automatically and you have to restart again and again to start using the internet. i noted this only after few days and now amazon won\\'t return the product as well. i researched about this on the internet and found other users are also facing this issue. i am trying to figure out if this issue can be resolved but lenovo as a brand has lost its value and i won\\'t recommend buying any of its phone ever. very good product. very first processor. awesome look. it is very bad product and overheating also.don\\' t buy this product for good i have buy this phone on november 2017..after three months phone is not working f9.in speaker mode mic is not working. authorised service denied to honour the warranty..feeling cheated,... powerful phoneeverything is outstanding it\\'s very lovely handset but it gets hot during some use. it\\'s an excellent phone. initially it had problems like battery drain. but after the update that problem has been solved. great performance, never lags and no heating problem. camera is satisfactory and selfie camera is excellent. overall it\\'s an underrated phone. it\\'s way better than redmi note 4 except for the battery back up. but it\\'s understandable as it has a more powerful processor. it is excellent worst phone. i am buy yesterday this new mobile phone but one defects occurred about earphones problem not working when jack plugin it, replacement mobile immediately... i have observed heating problem voice recording not availablebattery backup not good compare with lenovo k4note the product performance will be good and need to check for 2 weeks to no the quality of the product. heating problem battery is not that much goodit takes much time to charge then discharge worst phone. it is not working fine. apps are working itself. screen is moving and camera not good. awesome 1. cast - screen option not working...will only work with google chromecast bcoz of stock android.... don\\'t buy this phone if u own a smart tv2. missed call led light not working3. wifi direct not working prperly4. camera is not up to the mark5. battery after 25% ..... drains too much & very fast....6. heating is also an issue...मे तो लूट गया भाई.... great product.... really very good supper smoothly to use no hang average ........product its not for long lasting uses... can buy it if u want to use for 1yr only and then gift it to dustbin. not compatible with jio good phone.inbuilt compas is not there.schedule power off & on is not there. best burger phone. but there is little bit of lagginess while heavy gaming. very good world poorest quality phone not supported jio over heating.. everything is good. superb phnnbest battery lifeexcellent performancefastest phn processing nice, working good far happy with the received product good phone product had a defect / bug.. don\\'t have call recording option and call record app is not recording caller voice. wifi is disconnected frequently while connected to extender.camera, display, performance is very good.. very good product, everything find working fine. i bought this one at the first flash sell. here is my review after using this for a long time:pros:-dedicated mmc slot-a configurable hardware key-dolby sound enhancement-powerful cpu-front camera is really good+front flash-compass sensor (this was a deciding factor for me)-stock android (this could be both advantage as well as disadvantage. its good for those who wants simple phone and the advanced users who need root etc. those who wants great readymade ui features, don\\'t go for stock android. i am a root user but the problem is official kernel source not available)-a gesture which lowers ringing volume when u pick up the phone-fast fingerprint sensorcons:-dual rear camera is a total crap. it can\\'t detect edges properly-no 4k recording and time lapse which you should expect at this price range-have tones of software bugs (ex- display brightness flickering while watching youtube for a long time)-notification led only works with missed call, sms and gmail app-battery backup isn\\'t good-have heating issue-build quality: the phone is heavyweight. i can\\'t use vr headset more than 30 min. primary lense is getting dust easily. i have to clean it every 2 months.-lenovo\\'s ota update: lenovo is superslow in providing ota updates. users have reported all the bugs present in the phone. though lenovo isn\\'t taking actions.so, if you need a dedicated sd slot+compass sensor, then go for it. otherwise there is no reason to buy this phone. heating problem and camera issue mobile battery not good. mobile is too hot when playing any game product is not much better. bought it because of 64gb + other benefits but disappointed now. it\\'s been just a month and requested for a replacement of turbo charger by wasting a whole day in their service centre. not sure what standards they follow. quite disappointed. not recommended to buy. as lot of good things like 64 gb, camera features. the charge does not last for the day. please dont buy this very bad product hi i already used lenovo a7000 mobile i not feel any different between the both. thats 2900 mhv k8 is 4000 but no difference the battery.cemara performance was super.the only difference was make.need android 7.1.2unable to protect screen because the edge was curve type.conracts missed. what\\'s app and gmail\\'s contact are suddenly not showing some contacts are removing from everywhere.i faced the problem lenovo a7000 also. good phone. cant watch the video continuosly and can hear only audio after few min the video started playing. there is some second screen often coming up. rebooted the mobile twice and still nothing resolved. mobile is often heating up. both front and back camera is worst, clarity of the pixels r very low. after zooming the picture the pixels are blurred not matching 13mp it is beyond it. good for price received the product quite early, the phone was well packed and it is of good quality i like the phone speaker provided at bottom so sound effect getting less. otherwise performance is ok. good this is abeauty without brain. main issue with bluetooth connectivity and 4g connection. without 4g anyphone is a dumb phone. awesome product in lowest rate worst product , my phone speaker stops working after 20 days of purchasing, don\\'t know what to do nice after 7 month of usage, i am writing this.already given 2 times for service for battery issue..android ui in this phone is not up to the mark.sometimes turbo charging not working.. then charging time gets upto 20 hrs.no lagging no heating issue till now.i suggest not to take this phone guys. awesome mobile with fully loaded premium features .. best in comparison with other leading brands at similar price segment .. love lenovo k8 note device heatup quickly.take too much time to charge. according to mentioned features during shooping is none of them.waste of money got one replaced but same heating and fast battery drain issue persists. no headphone included dolby sound one side speaker not working sceen clearity very poor,heavy phone,processor is not as given,camara quality poor racing games are not opening and for other games it is taking more time to open the app. nice phone overall good but i think camera result is not so very good as described but it is satisfied... agar aap battry ko egnor kar do to baki garda phone h nice phone but battery are down so early is good but when i had buy it this time tell me hdfc card payment i will be some money refunded so so many times are spending but don\\'t refand my money so my request is expect. only one sim work as 4g..... camera quality not too good... camera is not good as redmi note 4. only one sim support 4g at a time, second support only 3g & 2g. processor, display, touch, sound are so good. heating problameand charging problame very good smart phone.and non hybrid so it\\'s meet the requirement of 2 sim plus memory card.good camera quality and no storage issue also. product nice.. but headphone missing in box... help me heat\\'s up ... bad, everything is bad.charge late,heating and many more problems.... camera performance very bad video clarity is not good, remaining all good... immediately after purchasing this product the price is reduced by rs. 2000/-. feeling unlucky with my purchase. also lenovo claims fast charging. but charging is very slow. camera quality is ok. product heats a lot while gaming and charging. nice mobile unexpected features at this price which is great......great work lenovo ....k8 .....thanks for this product very good user friendly mobile.. i like the model and also recommended to my other friend\\'s circle.. actually i was interested to buy 4gb and 64 by mistake i had selected 3gb and 32. shall i exchange my phone now. kindly advise. this phone is very good, it\\'s touch is very soft, full value of money, it\\'s camera is great & it\\'s awesome phone other than various phones. nice product.,been using it for almost 12 days now...performance and battery life both are good..clean ui, battery sot is 7+ hours gud but slightly heats up good one. all features are to the mark specially dolby atmosphere.but the only camera is not to the mark.this feature should be improved.lenovo company lacks in camera feature. after using phone for 4 months i can conclude that this is the worst phone of the year.... doesn\\'t capture network when you move from one location to other.. worst battery... camera quality ok. no dual 4g... right now i have idea 4g in my mobile but it\\'s speed is less than 2g of other network (no issue of sim card).. totally disgusting... frustrated with the purchase... no improvement though recent updates.. forget turbo charging in this phone u get turbo discharging feature also, u can use it to cook inlets and maggi, camera bokeh effect sometimes fades the subject feature like it even faded my beard, phone graphics is not good, bezels are thick good not good,1 at a 2 4g sims not working,( 1 will be on 4g + other then will be in 2g/3g)2 camera quality also not good.( back camera ( the worst phone i have ever bought . i bought it on 6th of oct and from 25th oct i started facing issues with the phone . within 3 hours of normal usage like what\\'s app, checking of mails and music listening ,the battery drops down from 100% to 26% . the quick charging is crap , it takes 6 hours for my phone to get charged from 26% to 90%. typing of this review is taking around 10 minutes as phone is getting hanged continuously . call reception is very poor , at thane station i don\\'t get internet signals. i don\\'t use camera or gaming and i feel pity for plight of such users. this phone is not capable of normal functions leave the smart fucntions . i feel like throwing this phone due to constant irritation .i strongly recommend don\\'t buy this phone as it offers amazing features on paper for cheap price .i also fell in the same trap wtf i bought this last month for 14k(4+64) now all of a sudden 2k has been reduced, now it\\'s available for 12k, never expected this from lenovo. no complaints about the device just fine. i didn\\'t like too much this product good in this range ... apart heating issues phone is great for normal day to day usage bluetooth is worst, battery super, it\\'s amazing to see such a phone but camera depth enable sensor is not working smoothly camera quality not good slim and beautiful.heating problem,battery is discharging very soon,call recording feature is not available, value for money facility wise very good phone.but video and photo quality should be improved lot.it will be better to provide amoled screen and additional ram with increased price. good mobile under 12000 awesome phone dont buy this phone. its really a chinese product..... even if it is giving 4300 mah batrery it works fine for just first 3 months then it actually starts showing its true color. its battery sucks like normal phone. its not even works for contineous 6 hours. try another phone. i wasted my 13k on this. so its my humble warning. it is very slowly charged and fastly completed. there is no gorilla glass. i received the broken screen product. is gorilla glass so delicate really.... it\\'s just fake publicity. the proximity sensor was not working correctly. battery is draining fast, it won\\'t last for the day....hardly 7-8 hours after full chargegot replacement after too much of hard work and calling. delivery boy was not taking the product. need to call customer care to convince him. getting replacement from amazon is a very tedious task. flipkart replacements are very easy and no questions asked.....plzz do not update to oreo...battery draining too fast...mobile getting so hot that u can iron your shirt....overall not happy with everything.... nice this phone was just osam.i had ever since features like this... very good product. value for money. as it is turbo charger but it takes more then 4 hrs to get charge. battery performance is very poor. superb handset..... this phone does not support cast feature which it’s earlier variant were supporting like k5 note.casting only works with chrome cast for which you spend another 3300 bucks.after oreo update the phone heats up like anything and dries up the battery.after k5 note i had set my expectations high from lenovo but this phone is a big disappointment. really good camera quality,loved the touch and screen enlagrment, really smooth, enough space, the best part is the dual camera facility at the back, and as well as loved everything about this phone.. dual sim slot along with memory card, when received already there was a back cover and screen card on it, best phone under 12000, really very much satisfied, user of 10 days only out of 32gb internal memory only 22 gb can be used.also some heating issue. very bed product mobile cover is not good . good product best battery back up and amazing camera quality mibile is good but back option key is left side is not good, and yellow flash is very big problem. the ultimate performer phone with all latest features nice look,gd battery backup, light in wt..bt,feeling ,something missing in android version,giving old feeling.one thing more,when we share files from one to another device,it goes slower..that goes against it\\'s processor......one thing about delivery process...it,s delivery process is than other competetive sites...it should be delivered before d given time..in my opinion.. travel adapter is not working condition. very good set product nice sir,but one charger,headphone missing,so please send that products immediately sirlenovo k8 note (fine gold, 4gb) i pay for gift but i couldn\\'t get the gift super very bad getting heating problem this device gets very hot during charging and net surfing. other wise great performance. superb phone..must buy... defective product. need refund for this product. i can\\'t believe amazon asking me to do troubleshooting for a brand new product with a faulty cam, battery and heating problem which is risky. performance is not upto the mark.. i bought this phone and within one week the problem begins. the battery heats up during charging and won\\'t charge more than 60% in 5 hours. i called up customer care and after a thorough examination, i could luckily get a refund from amazon. so if you think about buying this phone be prepared to waste a couple of days dealing with customer care. it emits a lot of heat. can\\'t hold it for longer period in hands and near ear while talking. i purchased ear phones and using them as alternative.the screen got scratches when i put it in my pocket along with bike keys. before buying i saw bharat nagpal - igyaan video in youtube. he showed that the screen wont get scratches even with knife. but its wrongmobile lags when playing small game like candy crush. forget about playing big games.battery is down in less than 5 hours. turbo charger is for name sake. full battery charging takes 1 hr 30 mins. good phone good product asom phone within a month turbo charger is not working and heating problem don\\'t buy this product , after 6 month it\\'s heating, and hanging. phone book not working.... good not worth all basic and important features are missing. 1. no sound/mute/vibrate button, 2. no inbuilt call recording, 3. no group option in contact manager, 4. it is only lte but not volte. lenovo is a renouned company but how they made lenovo k8 note without basic features. we expect updates on the basic features metioned here. good product. we bad experience with lenovo , after buying phone 3 day mobile fall from chair & display get damage . visit service center where they refused to replace under warranty , even i agree for paid repair they don\\'t have display & how much it will cost , so i pay advance 1k & order display after waiting for one month and several call & visit to service center they put new display which cost 8000 , for mobile which i buy for 14000.on 29 sept some how i get my mobile back where music button is not working due camera is f**\"up , can\\'t take pictures or do recording ,no bokeh effect . worst service center in mapsa-goa lenovo made good hand set in this cost and features r good speed is good i really using this mobile it performs is very nice lenovo fullfill every dream of customer it\\'s heat up when you charge the phone or watching movies, battery drain fast. it\\'s support quick charge but if you use wi-fi then definitely two or more times must be require to charge the phone. 2 ringer speaker in phone but one not work when i check after delivery.. fake ass company call recording and video call using time not working front camera light this phone doesn\\'t meet my expectations. after using it for three days i found that this phone is lacking so much responding slow camera quality is not good even after having two rear cameras. this phone makes me think as i am using an old phone. there are so many bugs in this phone. sometimes clock is not showing up the right time. overall bad experience. i choose this phone over redmi note 4 and i think i made a bad decisio. for the first time i purchased lenovo and it is a bad experience. the only good thing about this phone is dolby atmos. you can get better options to choose from in this price segment. the phone has no wireless display system. as such you can\\'t use it with smart tv. this is major drawback of the phone. good phone. the only two cons are the heating issue while charging and the camera quality not up to the mark. third class phone i will never recommend any body. facing heating issue while playing game. and during on going call heating starts after 15 minutes. back camera full dull.. very bad support.poor camera clarity...heating problem....headphones not included... selfi is no more... totally this is not a good product... same rate honour 6x is good for us... nice camera vand ful awesome mobile gud camera gud sound value for money issue in this phoneheatinghotspot not working properly nice phone,nice features but brightness very very low, tried to return it but we can\\'t return it ,even contacted customer service also but they said we can only replace it i have purchased 2 set. overally its gud. value for money. powerful performance. looking nice. camera quality normal. heating problem...over heating..but its good bettary problem nice peace for lenovo k8note very good phone. simply loved it. i am giving my review after using this phone for more then a week.here are some pros and cons i have listed based on my personal use.cons:1. battery drains faster at idle time.2. depth sensor of dual camera is not perfect, the edges of the subject gets blurred.3. doesn\\'t come with call record feature, but you can install boldbeast recorder app for that.4. contacts doesn\\'t display contacts from sim card.5. lock screen doesn\\'t lock instantly when phone screen goes off, you can still swipe to unlock.(u can lock it by pressing the unlock icon on lock screen for 3 seconds.)(hoping lenovo will fix these bugs and release the updates shortly.)pros:1. phone charges from 0-100% in 2 hours. my old k5 phone would take more then 3 hours to charge.it takes around 3-4 hours to charge with a 5v 2.0a charger, and 4-5 hours with a 5v 1.0a charger.(phone gets a little warm while charging with the turbo charger but with 5v 2.0a and 1.0a charger the phone temperature doesn\\'t increase at all.)charging stops automatically with battery is fully charged.2. rear camera has professional feature which allows you to manually adjust the focus with a slider(hats off to that), you can adjust the shutter speed too.it has an auto hdr mode for both front and rear camera.photos come good at low light conditions.3. phone gets a little warm while playing higher end games with data or wifi on, doesn\\'t heat a lot like other mediatek phones do.4. music quality is great with dolby atmos.5. easily gives backup for 4-5 hours while playing games with wifi or data on. for normal use battery lasts for an entire day.(install greenify for longer battery backup).6. display lighting is great even in outdoors.reply for some misleading reviewers:-1. this phone has google music to play audio and it has google photos app instead of gallery and you can view videos using it.2. some people complainging about poor music quality most probably have a music player app which controls the audio drivers using its own equilizer, which in turn disables the dolby atmos.3. i had no network issues with my phone, signal strength is good.4. phone never restarted on its own at any point of time.5. i did not experience any performance drop.6. i did not experience any call drops.7. wifi gets connected almost instantly when turned on. received phonenot received ear phone; only received chargerthis is not tolerable bill is incomplete and receivedin box one charger processor and both camera are great not a good choice price is too much according to specification.. awesome mobile this phone is very bad total maney weast phonebattery and flash light

mobile a good product superb performance..... and camera quality is also good using this phone since 3 days, here are my reviews.1. camera is not upto the mark at all, dual camera does not work properly moreover the camera pictures does not like taken from a 13 mp camera,comparing it with lenovo k4 note camera both takes similar quality picturesso disappointed with the camera.2. battery lasts good upto 15% after that it finishes up within 10-12 min even when the phone is idle.3.design of the phone is also average, although it really does not matter for me that much thats why i purchased it.4, can\\'t talk much about performance but till now it\\'s fine ,only 1 time the phone lagged while opening whatsapp.5.bought this product because i was using k4 note and was quite satisfied with that but not with this one.6.overall disappointed with the product was expecting much with the camera please do not buy this phone cuz many handset are having heating and battery drain

comparing all available brands ( nokia6, moto gs+, redmi 4, ...etc) in this segment with over 5 days of research, i got k8 note 4gb. it has been on par considering all recent feature. just go 4 best....tc love it worst product is delivered today and packet is also re taped. bad experiences. requesting for return. phone not working as expected. i replaced it once but again facing same issue. blutooth not working properly after connecting to speakers.it\\'s buffering while playing songs after connecting.wifi hotspot is not visible in laptops.otherwise a good phone. good mobile... avarage camera... hi bought this phone in december. the phone features are awesome. but there\\'s is bluetooth connectivity issue. the same was informed to amazon and the phone was replaced. but the replaced phones also has the same issue. hence returning the phone. over all its bad phone the phone is getting heated up on continuous usage for more than 30minutes. have display problem & has develop only after the exhaust of return period it\\'s heat when using with net, not worth. i don\\'t recommend to by this product. i liked the design and sound quality, display it\\'s good it\\'s heats a bit, but it\\'s fine. due to metal body, phone processor is super fast i purchased the above phone on first sale in amazon. no doubt it is a good phone. but i don\\'t find anything extraordinary other than \\'deca core\\', separate slots for two sims and sd card and looks. the phone gets heated very fast. the main drawback i noticed is that \\'lenovo k8 note\\' fails to connect when the \\'mobile data\\' is switched on. at that time one is not able to upload or download any audios or videos or pictures except receiving and forwarding chat messages. on such occasions, one finds a small \\'x\\' at the below right end of the coverage icon of service provider. thereafter, it was noticed that phone could not detect any nearby device through bluetooth. and soon after a few days, it was noticed that the phone would not connect to wi fi also. therefore, the smartphone became almost useless for me.thus, i find that lenovo k8 note is one of the worst device. i was forced to return the device and i must appreciate amazon for their prompt response in arranging return pick and also issuing refund on the same day. so the only good experience in purchasing the above phone was the amazing service provided by amazon. battery is not powerful enough. takes a lot of time to charge. phone heats up. call recording is not available , camera quality not good ,depth sensing worst , but phone is fast not bad but before buying think twice... network problem 4g , sound is not work clarity, only one speaker work,not support for amaezon ,,bad experince in amezon. handset is quite good. camera & clarity very nice. processing is very good.though the battery capacity is 4000+mh it\\'s gets drain out in 14 to 18 hours. gets heat up some times. phone looking is good but heating is so much.. and hanging also great news battery drain after 7 months of use...and now not supported to turbo charging.. disappointed lenovo k8 note very bad experience. ..at per value not upto mark.if you are thinking for this please immediately change the way. .....other wise waste money. it should be supported volte.... please don\\'t buy received faulty product has heating, battery drain & network issue good very nice mobile not satisfied ... camera quality is not good ... excellent phone... camera quality is awesome. front camera rear camera much much better. good product.charging is very fast bcoz turbo charging.no heating problem.low cost and features is much more in this phone. processor is so fast.go and purchased. aswome best in range and quality tempered glass not stick.....air bubbles form in display nice handset display material not ok phone is good but camera is not good.dual camera features is not understand and significance of dual camera is beyond to understand. heating

perfect and another 4g slot not supported in jio sim i bought lenove k5 note earlier which is far better than lenovo k8 note.... good one.. very cool nice phone do not buy this mobile. it keeps switching off on its own. mine is only 6 days old. very annoyed with lenovo. battery backup not good just awesome,good camera,storage,audio,video quality,budget phonebefore time delivery from amazon phone is good, but overheating is an issue. even without gaming, just using facebook, whatsapp and browser the phone heats up quickly it has worst software i have never seen up to now ... alarm and

amazon give a very good exchange offer my pervious phone. average very worst phone .for buying this phone waste of money.amazon response also very worst.after buying this phone i informed to customer care ,my phone battery not charging properly.i informed to customer care they have not support to me. the product is reasonably good for the price you pay. only problem while charging it heats up. this is one of the major irritant. very good and user-friendly phone .. i am not giving any star . due to mandatory i am given one star product is very bad. phone heating is more. if some one wants to purchase i can suggest don\\'t go for this. i am writing this review after using this product for 10 months. as per its specification(4gb ram and deca-core processor) this phone should be outstanding in performance, which is not true. booting of this phone is slow. after booting takes some time to get in stable condition (a state from where i can use it).rest of the things are pretty convincing, but there are better options available in market with same price range. send me invoice bill battery is worse fast drain.. getting heat even in pause mode . i am expecting lenovo should overcome these problems by adding some software. phone is good but battery usage is quiet high good product please don\\'t select this mobile. net work is not available camera is not work charging down qukly and also most worest mobile in the lenova k8 note. please don\\'t select in your friends also please. repleasement is not qukly i replacement ordered in 22.9.2017 not mention in delivery date its good awesome phone but there is issue in turbo charging battery is not good. value for money..... totally worth it. nice phone,camera quality is good,look is good but it\\'s heating problem but overall nice phone a good mobile at this pricebattery backup is goodphone also charges quicklyselfie camera is goodrear camera is averageportrait mode alone sucksi have experienced no lag so fardoes not get much heated up either dolby atmos app sucks coz i hv to forcestop every time in order to make it work not easily user freindly. worst mobile ..getting highly heated when surfing internet and charging ..not good battery back up ...not compatible with other us charger ..plz don\\'t buy ..wastage of money ..not eligible for 0.5 star nice phonecamera quality is finebattery is very goodgood to usedolby atmos feature is good worest mobile ever i have been usedheated too much and charge stands only 4hrs good one but not one of the best....earlier version was more good. battery problem after half day it\\'s becoming switched off beautiful phone....great rear camera.check the bench marks of this phone better than other same range phones.its handy. fingerprint is very swift. duap camera setup not so good. battery is not also good. good enough.but head phone is missing you give me wrong phonephones one spiker is not working awesome phone with great battery performance not good camera is good but the system is not up to our expectation..... turbo charging takes 2 hours to charge... not fast..... and the battery longs only for 6 hours...... ......@@heating issue is the failure of this mobile....... heats a lot..... over all good..... if u r looking for good mobile buy moto g5 plus or nokia 6 or lonova p2.......k8 is not good but same way not bad camera not so good..... customization is so bad....no music app.... no video app sir mera charger khrab ho gya very worst product....it\\'s too much heavily heating...it not charging many times...not even good speed. hetting issue & playing video quality not good turbo charging not working one of the best phone in this price range phone is very slow getting logged call recording feature not working... network issue on both sim slot. same sim works fantastic on other phone\\'sno call or voice recordingspeaker output is bad.overall bad buy. nice good phone amazing featuresdisplay clarity is averagephoto clarity and resolution is averagegood battery back up while using mobile datajio volte supportout off 100 i would give 70 marks... good speed and performance with ultra fast touch sensor but having some problems like you can\\'t save the new contacts in your sim on paper seems to be the best. i bought it in the first flash sale. dual camera doesn\\'t seem to be so promising. headphone output very inferior, dolby atmos has to be superior but it is inferior to even the low range phones. battery too doesn\\'t behave as 4000 mah. some software lags.. the double touch to wake isn\\'t consistant. few minute features missing as it is stock android like no vibration when charger connected, no battery percentage indicator while charging. unimpressed with it in comparison with k4 and k5 note. hence returned it. giving 2 rating only keeping in view of its features listed on paper. lenovo has to do a lot to uplift it\\'s performance and service centres too. the availability of accessories is also cumbersome, though available the price is not similar at all service centres located in the same city. after introduction of gst a few service centres are hesitant to give bill and warranty to accessories; indicating unprofessional practices from lenovo. average phone with buget price mobile is average battery is heating pls solution give me any.... nice product.. amazon products are truly reliable nice phone this phone is amazing.nd best at this price ,superb camera nd everything it\\'s true my moto g4 plus is also not working properly... consworst handset it doesn\\'t have default sound recorder , in headphones volume very is less , battery drains fast ,not able to save contacts in sim, and it doesn\\'t have applock after using the phone for 1 week found these serious problems...battery drains very quickly even if you keep the phone in idle it still loses 10-15% battery from 100% (it drains 10-13% overnight)signal bar continously fluctuating up and down. even i am standing on a cell phone tower ( cell tower is 50 meters from my house) there is still not full network on my phone.signal bar changes continuously which results on poor battery life.earpiece volume is too low i can\\'t hear the caller\\'s voice clearly and call quality is also poor.notification light doesn\\'t work properly.camera depth enabled option have issue in taking photos. blur is not perfect in edges.heats up too much during browsing or video playback.music quality is not good even it has dolby atmos the sound is too low in earphone (tried in 2-3 earphones)incoming calls not working in volte(lte) when the phone is in idle mode for 5min. nice phone and screen was so nice colors this mobile phone is not proper working every time is hangi am not happy this phone ok..thank u worst mobile i have ever bought. it is waste of money, don\\'t buy plz.heating problem even after repleshment.battery problem slow charging & discharge very fast without using mobile or stand by mode. not good( bty performance very bed) guys i buyed this phone and i can tell you it\\'s not worth it there are many problems in itthe biggest of all is heating problem it always feel like m holding a hot iron in my hand.10 minutes of talking and even ears get heated up u cannot talk for more than 10 minutes it keeps on getting hot . the camera and touch is ok we have better phone in the same price rangelast not worth of spending on this phone..... it is a hot iron good nice nice phone for the price. superb mobile little heat but gud and getting hang is very big problem very good product. value for money. good fantastic camera not good... 5 out of 2 phone heated at around 46 degree even if phone is not in use. battery discharged within 2 hours. lenovo service centre also kept phone for 2 days. never to buy from this seller. a quality smartphone in medium budget. very bad,missuse money, battery backup is very weak,not led plus,heating issue,amazon is not satisfaction anything,worst brand is lenovo,not support volt. mobile battery not good very good good product but facing bluetooth headset connection problem...break the voice when data connection is on....need to slove it updates. good really good phone at good price this phone is very excellent without hang product and company. display not sharp unlike other brands also phone heating problems, camera not impresive, would not recommend this phone. battery issue genuine product! best in this range. front camera: 3/5rear camera: 2/5battery life: 3/5processor: 4/5 amazon shipping was excellent. the product came in just 2 days.pros:1) looks and feel of premium quality. overall a good phone for the price.2) separate music/ programmable key button is nice to have.3) selfie flash helps in the low light area.4) 4000mah battery and 4gb and 64 gb memory.5) two nano sims with separate tray for external memory card.cons1) heating is a big issue. phone heats up a lot even when not playing those high end games. though it does not degrade performance.2) camera -> average- pic taken from lenovo k8 16 mp front camera with flash in low light turned out to be inferior than my friends 1 plus 5 16mp camera without flash. even without flash- pics taken from rear dual camera 16mp (in regular mode) came out blurry (1st pic) . and it seems they added auto beautification to make pic smooth, which did not help. my older coolpad note 3 with 13mp was much sharper (2nd pic)3) battery even fully charged drained out by 60% in 6 ours with normal usage. when i play golf clash it drains out much faster. if i play continuously, i believe the phone might die out in less than 3 hours.4) the phone feels little heavier.5) box does not come with headphones or scratch guard.6) back button is on the left side different than other phones. also the bottom keys are not back lit. a very good phone... worth buying amazing camera,and sound quality is too good buke effect is so much bad the phone arrived on the day mentioned by amazon, very prompt delivery, thanks!its an amazing phone, the screen and display is great, with a good processor and the battery lasts the whole day with heavy use.the \\'music key\\' is also a great addition, very handy. i have wasted my 14000rs on it..it has very bad display,colours looks very dull, poor camera,poor screen,poor battery life worthless..... battery optimisation not very good. it is draining very quickly. depth enabled mode is not accurate . camera not able to pick out focused subject in the mode. device is bit heavy.otherwise the device is pretty solid.1. quick charging time.2. good brightness under direct sunlight.3. loud speaker.4. faster loading time even for heavy games.5. good front and back camera.7. software easy to use and stutter free.buy it if you like it.delivery was next day itself.all the best. decent phone in this price.pro-good battery, stock android, speaker is good,fast charging, front camera with flash ¡great¡cons- dual camera not that great, doesn\\'t have ir blaster, no balckled keys. not satisfied , voice over lte is a bad example for volt rest is all ok and working smother good dolby sound kadak phone as compared to my old k4 note it\\'s not good don\\'t purchasebad parfomanceand no any help with amazon it\\'s been almost 2 months and i don\\'t see any issues (hopefully won\\'t see for longer period, fingers crossed. the performance, picture quality and durability looks good. at this price range can definitely be an option to think about. old don\\'t buy this ... worst phone ever, believe me. doesnt charge with basic powerbanks or adapters. worst audio output quality on earphones or headphones. worst camera and phone ever heated up quickly , battery also not supporting, i used vibe k5 note it is good ,but i am not happy with k8 note. old version of android was more user friendly good camera gay\\'s dont by this phone if you camera lover dual cam was warest and i was complained custmer care and they send phone service gay they see camera and is tack same pics .in the pics is seeing the blur on pics and is saying its good i sad your not seeing ani blur on the pics am not seeing and extr.......in this phone good mobile phone poor camera performance best smart phone ever good phone but camera is not up to the mark over all a decent phone for those who r moderate users very good phone.... ex apart from battery everything is superb better for me very nice as expected bluetooth is properly not workingphone is heating it got heat up at top-back side is the only issues. otherwise phone is good. i did not get my handset how do i get it good here are the some points i have noticed.1. battery backup is not good,in idle condition is draining so fast.2.cell standby is sucking the battery near about 20% near about 1250 from 4000mah.3. ram management always running @2gb if u will clear or stop background application then also it will not come down.4.for missed call alert led will not blink.5.in idle condition battery is draining about 10% which means near about 800 mah out of 4000mahso near about 2000mah battery is draining from cell standby & idle mode.awesome features about lenovo k8 note1.camera is awesome picture quality is awesome.2.display is superb3.sound quality is awesome4.fingerprint is very fast best phone under 15k,most of plus point is it\\'s not hybrid simwell battery drains bit quick but already got 3 updates so now it\\'s become better killer note worth for this amount. shiva nice camera is too good n it\\'s very fast.i liked it. i am using smartphones since nokia 6600, but need to say that this phone is ridiculous among them. overheating, weird touch behaviour and most terrible screen flickering and horizontal lines at left side of screen going from top to bottom . even i replaced phone. and amazon care promised that they will refund full money if same problem persist in exchaned phone but now saying that there is no policy of refund. dont buy this phone. heating issue ..other are good. very good product from lenovo. its functions very smoothly.battery backup is good.mic and speakers are very clear. i like it. turbocharger is not working good. it\\'s very hard to handle . over weight and thickness too . battery was just ok . all other options were as regular as in 10k pieces except dual rear camera . wait for some more time to pick better product than this in this price it took almost 3 hours to charge from 0 to. 100 mobile is such a good....camera is also but the double camera effect not work properly.... if u a mi user??u can\\'t satisfy..other wise good.. good phone with very bad image quality. waste phone..in the world..worst battery life....they say that the phone has tarbo charging but it takes decades to charge 100killer phone .. killing people with bad performance 😥 truly awesome dupalicate mobile lenovo is battery backup not good best in class ,low price but big features. good product ok camera quality is really very worst !!dual camera hell....guys if u r looking for a good camera fone..juz dont go for it !!at this price uhll get some toher bttr fone !! very bad phone don\\'t go with the phone if you are love surfing. poor battery life. die so fast that you can\\'t believe what u brought.mi note 4 far more better in battery and user interface customisation. awesome....nice phone from lenovo...much much better than redmi note 4. nice performance. thanks to amazon team. one suggestion to amazon team please make delivery fast as it took 7 days for delivery after placing the order. thanks once again. its a piece of amazing perfection. but it battery needs to be improved a bit. as it heats up quite fast. don\\'t worry when the phone gets heated like, it\\'s on a frying pan, while it\\'s charging. that\\'s common \\'phenomenon\\'. better but old type function overall performance is good.camera is worst, clarity of the pixels r very low.i was just browsing & playing game then it is getting heating up a lot.ram management is not good. poor network on jio n airtel 4g...returned the next day. satisfied one....😃 please do not buy lenovo k8 note... i am suffering from last 2 months. in between this time period i had attend lenovo service center for 5 times because of battery issue, quick battery drain, hand set over heating upto 44deg, & hand set hank after system update orio. still now those issues are not solved by them(service center or lenovo company) i have also contract with lenovo toll free number but i did not get any kind of help, only they are told me this issue is solvable but my question is when and how... so my opinion is don\\'t buy this phone if you do not want to face the problem... it\\'s quite good good phone battery is not charging in standby position so we have to switch off the handset then plug into charging.always there\\'s a option or a error about \"this app has stopped working\".i don\\'t know why it happens repeatedly.please try to fix in this problem. superior camera quality.nice and affordable budget phone. screen damage within warranty worrest product overall good phone ! dual camera is not that impressive and slightly heavy phone. happy with battery backup, no lagging issues front camera and rear camera is good! extremely useless phone after using it there is no pro for this handset only consscreen mirror is there but it doesn\\'t workmemory card slot is there but frequently memory card get crashed and lost all data many timesafter updating phone hanging very badly automatically switched off many times due to the same loss of many dealspower on is very slowthey say that this handset have gorilla glass my friend bought same model with me it\\'s display is now brokennever buy this handset don\\'t worth the price they are quotingcustomer support is very poor it too good...i like this phone..cool size and camera quality...dolby audio..awam hi,it has been a month since i have using this product. one problem that i am facing from the start of usage is the hanging nature of contacts and phone application. the basic functionality expected of the device malfunctioning is an irritating at times.however the rest of the apps work fine. even playing games doesn\\'t cause any problem. requesting for problem resolution from concerned. android 8.1 update not available,device over heating problem,network problem etc,dont buy this mobile.. my network is not working .very bad response to indian band ntwork receptor worst. both the sims not working with 4g lte mode,also when

call support. earpiece volume is also very low. best mobile with good configuration at this priceafter using mobile for 2 weeks i,m writing this review, most of the reviews are fake in my opinion lenovo k8 note hasgood cameragood battery lifeno heat issuegood displaysome of drawbacks are slow charging it\\'s take more than 1 hour to charge from 30 to 100 percentage. another one is no headset with mobile. as the phone heats up a bit to much. it has only a single star rating for me. after using the product for three months found following issues1 . heats very much2.battery drains out very fast3. turbocharging takes a lot of time after an updatewill not recommend this product now .earlier i felt this was a good product nice phone but dont expect much from dual back camera, front camera

satisfied for this product...heating problem solve ..camera little bit improve.... very poor quality battery backup...only write 4000mah battery to attract people...very worst product...samsung 3300 mah battery backup much more batter than lenovo k8 note...... first of all earphones are not provided with the phones but what about its itnernal features lenovo has done changes that we cannot record the call like in earlier models.and as per the specifications instead being available on discount the phone is quite costly as compared to other phones present in market with more and great latest features available.and the thing i needed the most call recording is missing. i request to send an ugrade for the same as soon as possible. rest phone is working fine till now lets see further.and for amazon atleast keep the return window open for 10 days. phone over heated and charge will not worked properly product is really good and price is also worth. currently i m not facing any issues. value

product. super fast. nicly built. i loved the mobile very much. but i am disappointed with packing of producr. it\\'s worst of all. no safety for mobile. it\\'s just a cardboard packing. so amazon please provide food packing good wrost phone not satisfied worthlessi request ppl not to buylenidi k5 (i was used) is better than thiski is waste phone. so far so good good product but have no fast charging not satisfied by this phone. not as per expectations.- heats a lot (curtosy: mediatek processor)- battery life isn\\'t great (doesn\\'t even last a complete day on average usage, keeps draining quickly even on standby - i don\\'t have many power intensive apps)- not very ergnomic to hold. the corners are very sharp.- camera is ok-ok. dual camera (depth mode) isn\\'t precise. while recording videos, i have noticed the lens is focusing multiple times.. and as a result it keeps blurring and focusing giving a poor outcome video when u see the video again later.- visibility under sunlight is not that great. brightness is generally less. if u increase brightness means it consumes more power.- takes a long long time to charge. wonder why they call turbo charging.- i noticed some issue with my handset, not sure if it\\'s common across lenovo k8 note. although there are 2 speakers, left ones is very weak. the right speaker is strong and loud.i wouldn\\'t recommend this phone, especially when there are good phones in price bracket. moto g5s plus is much better choice - even if it means spending few bucks extra. great phone killer features before i buy it,i thought it would going to heat,after one month of hard usage i didn\\'t get any heat issues and turbo charger is doing greatoverall it\\'s a beast nice feature amazing phone before buying i heard a lot of rumours about the charging issues sound quality and over eating but actually i never had one and i am really delighted to have this mobile highly recommend you to buy it thank you nice one good phonebest front camera 1.too much of heating while browsing....2. all background app has to be restarted frequently...ex truecaller,.rest all fine. love the phone depth mode camera is not working properly. can any one suggest how to adjust or settings for depth mode. how to charge this handset without wire. and how to add shortcut key in the notification panel. bad great one. no heating issues after using for 2months. very poor battery perfarmece also network problem. not up to the mark buy it now.supperbbbbb updated the latest version of software.device is getting heated up to 38 degrees with minimal usage of features, no gaming. signal problems. full charging is taking 2 to 2.5 hrs.camera is decent. received the handset 1 day before the promised date. requested for refund and they have processed my request. awesome device.... everything just works perfectly....haven\\'t encountered any glitches....camera is very good...processing is alsa nice...battery backup goes whole day on 4g data left speaker not working. cheat. who is the responsibility of this phone...?very very bad amazing feature this mobile given best experience ......... phone is very slow. best phone i got it for 9989 under sale mobile over heting not confteble all performance is goodbut battery heating and backup problembattery backup only 3-4 hour on paper features are very good.but practically it\\'s useless phone.after using some days. this phone hangs lot. specially while opening contacts & messages. best and affordable in the class this is just an average phone with above average specs mentioned in sale document.what\\'s good- screen size is large and good if you like it- value for money is goodwhat could have been better or is not that good- the camera is below average inspire of having a dual camera. the pictures in low light is quite poor.- the back button is on left side of bottom screen, so one hand operation is not easy- battery life is good as per specifications but in reality it hardly lasts for complete day with average usage and not more than 10 minutes of game play- user interface was better in previous models- there is no option to cast the screen to smart tv\\'s like all older models of lenovo. this is a big drawback. have battery problem not getting charged & if got charged it gets down in 15 min nice phone in this price rangeturbo charger takes too much time to charge the battery and heating issues also there excellent waste of moneyuseless processor camera quality is great as promised battery quality bad nice phone pls don\\'t buy this phone!!this phone is not at all worth the moneyworst cameraoverheats a lotsince its a mediatek...the idle battery drain is too high...you can\\'t get even 4 hours of heavy usage..you can even go with redmi phones like note 4 or a1... nice phone...with great battery backup and memory... sound and camera quality is also good not best....but it\\'s ok... this is the worst phone i have never seen i was using k4 note it was good so that is the reason i have taken this k8 note phone but there is no auto call regarding and no cast for screen sharing and you can\\'t cancel the call for the cast i have trying to do some steps from developer tab but that also no use.thanks for lenovo for this kind of productsathish kumar best mobile charger doesn\\'t work.atleast one year doesn\\'t completed.what should i do?even amazon doesn\\'t have spares.like this turbo charger.i hope ,you share service support contact details in chennai i have got my phone y\\'day,, i will increase the stars but i am not able to send messages from my phone to any number.. i tried to see message center number and i put there number then one message went through but after restarting the phone phone same issue.. i am hoping to get this issue resolved or i will have to send it back to amazon.. is it a issue faced by other users as well or i have got a defected piece ?/ can anyone plz help.. thnxxx phone lack lot of apps and short cut keys.while going through the settings found there is no key for changing the phone in silent/vibrate mode, mail app is missing, to clean trash/memory have to use third party app. music key is not working, camera not as discribed. lot of setting/option missing if compared to other latest phones that also lower price than k8. superb experience good one don\\'t buy very bad !!wifi hotshot is not working properly..... mobile gets heated when i browse for 10 mins and when playing games you can\\'t touch the mobile and the call volume is very low received a faulty product. camera quality very poor, had issues with network connectivity in the new k 8 note, hence returned the handset.my previous lenovo k 4 note was superb. little heavy. poor, very poor phone. good display. camera is not as good as the ads show. k5 note had a pretty good camera and this one\\'s not much of an improvement. processor is awesome and that\\'s the only good thing here. phones heating effect makes the whole deal not worth it. lenovo shouldn\\'t be even selling phones that causes so much heat. disappointed with that part its an awesome phone in low budget good mobile at this price. good ok for the price range it\\'s not so bad. there are issues with notification led and inaccurate \"bokeh\" effect. but lenovo has been pushing out regular patches for it. the build quality and the battery life might not be the best, but it\\'s still something to be happy about. i an overall happy with the purchase and the device. very good mobile great product, good build quality, excellent camera, light weight worth purchase. v good product worth price! good performance, great clarity pics. superb! 👍 loved it awesome got what i had expected........ loved the camera and the performance is awesome its good phone but some features needs to b improved like message app, n saperate music n video player should b there good but, scren is so delicate. best mobile around 10k.. i\\'m amazed with this phone.! weight & size is on higher side rest everything is perfect. excellent product with budget.... amazing.... nice product the few cons i could find, are1. heavy.2 screen to size ratio.and speaker is not loud enough. nice phone.. some features r missing like auto power on off.. but nice phone.. speed operating gud experience. the dual sim socket seems a problem. its switches off automatically . not sure if its problem with device or the product i received. its painful to use this phone this phone is not proper working.......1. charging problem.2. heating problem.3. not like this 10 core processor nd.4. not a better for snapedragon 820 phone keeps switching off on it\\'s own..over heats and takes a long time to charges and battery drains out less than 12hrs ..don\\'t buy this phone... i am using the phone from last 5 month it\\'s nice to use. but battery is draining fast and turbocharger not working..5 hours take for 100% charging. phon is awsome this mobile not getting sterio sound gorilla glad seems not original as scraths have appeared on screen specs rich product. but performance not meeting as per specs.specially cameras. stupidity please don\\'t buy.dont waste your money. good product, but not better than samsung awesome mobile and excellent performance in the mobile , in camera except bokeh effect everything is awesome still haven\\'t face anything like that worth for money.. a very good phone. worst product. network dropping problem duringcall . discussed with amazon , their application shows no prolblem . so we have to use this faulty mobile.@amazon : order no : order # 406-2999907-1285932 after oreo update the phone hanging big problem is charging slowly charging also fast draining proble worst mobile. there are no minimum features. the best mobile using last 15day and on time delivery best experience 1.auto call recorder is not in that2. notification is not shown on screen if any number blocked3.back camera is not taking solid picture in darkness battery back up is very poor. high drain out bakwas product. good features and camera quality is good,in depth mode quality is superb. product is good...decent camera 📷,nice sound qualitylittle bit heatingbut very very poor packaging worst phone by lenovo...all the application suddenly stops working while using it...if it\\'s the last phone on earth still don\\'t buy. lenovo claims deca core processor but performancene is lesser than the phone having four core processor. charging time is very more.... minimum 4 to 5 hours great experience with tis amazing product from lenovo.it is equipped with almost every features that a smartphone required.deca core processor long lasting battery and 64gb internal memory with 4gb ram is just awesome.i would certainly recommend this phone for users having usage and game lovers nice one phone gets hang too much and battery discharge too fast.really disappointed from phone great one ! loved the phone ! go for it phone is good in performance but battery is draining quickly i hope it will improve by updates nd back camera too needs to get upgrade hello friends,i am using this phone for last two days. my review is1) company is claiming to have helio x23 but actually is helio x20 if u install cpu-z software u can check it.2) camera has no issues, it is working fine.3) mobile has some issues with heating as it has helio precossor.4) battery drains fast as it works 10-12 hours on low to medium usage.i haven\\'t installed any games yet so i can\\'t give my comments on that. nice product and process by amazon battery drainage issues on first day. this phone has a major bug. if the phone is kept idle for 15 mins(with wifi and data off and no calls for 15 mins), the software of the phone automatically goes into sleep mode, and if someone is calling you after 15 mins, he or she will hear that the number is unreachable. awesome product with cheap price. i have not found any heating problem. stylish with quality camera thanks superb phone i have used till date.excellent rear duel camera. people are in love with my phone. on time delivery... worth for cost.. i like it very worst mobile worst product good nd both primary nd secondary cameras super clarity, battery pack up is good.overall the mobile is good video call option is also not thereno slow mption recordingno 4k recordingjust a average camera. camera not upto the mark. voice quality not good compare to note 4. moreover feels cheated as the price dropped out by almost 3000 in a month. we cheated by showing us sale price.no more lenovo awesome phone...keep it up lenovo. but i am having the worse delivery experience service from amazon. the phone is so cool.its processor so fast .trust me guys this phone is better then lg,, motorolla, mi, of all lestest models cons: 1.heating issue - phone easily gets at around 40 degrees while charging and also while playing heavy games or camera.2. camera - after the software update you may experience depth mode little better, still the edges get blurred.3. battery backup - its written 4000mah but equivalent to 3500mah.4. slight slutter, no lag5. 4 gb ram variant is preferable & for performance as well and also black variant looks cool and premium.6. you cannot put a tempered glass on its display as 2.5d curved edges will show up bubbles around edges.7. they did provide a turbo charger but it takes 2.2 hours for this phone to charge fully. very good product......but fedex delivered this goods too much late..... it was purchased by me on 8th october 2017, but it is not working properly it is automatically getting swtiched off. iam surprised within 50 days problem is occurred and quite disappointing. please replace the same. iam not at all satisfied the network keeps on fluctuating and the calls get disconnected on its own. there\\'s a problem with the sim slots...please provide an update. कडक mobile 1 no major heating problem . can\\'t hold it after 30 mints use. i am afraid after using it . headphone should be included bed smartphone dual camera but single camera better than dual cam...and always lenovo smartphone one issue is not good camera so noise and 2nd problem is hanging problems.. good... front camera flash is low initially i reviewed this phone with 5 star and good comments but after 8 months now editing review with 1 star(0 not available). so let me start...1. after oreo update this phone sucks.. it get charged extremely slow.. heat terribly high... bettery drain fast... and i went to customer care center and they did reset and reinstalled software but then even this phone sucks.. problem remain same ...after security update from lenovo it still the same without any improvement...2. they say gorilla glass but it got broken with minor fall and too with protective glass on.. so now i have to spend 3800 for repair even though my touch works fine they do not change only glass thst worth 400 bucks only...3. its not only me who is facing problem my cousin has same phone , two of my class mates have same phone and we all are facing same problems. i love this phone very bad product battry backup is very poor charching problem and hitting. i am purchasing phone 26 aug but my imei no not found in systen. one of the worst phone i have ever used, very poor network signal. i was using rn3 and was getting full signal on jio and airtel but on k8 i am hardly getting 2 bars. battery backup is very poor, hardly goes for the day, charged full in morning and was running out of juice in the evening with normal usage. normal camera performance, found no difference in rn3 camera shots and of k8. nice phone good phone only camera is not good display cast is not working. heating is more.this is not a killer phone just to fool the buyers. best phone..use 6 month no issues at all best mobile with good battery performence good superb.. good, fast and handy. speaker voice is little bit low. adorable it\\'s good product by lenovo. am using this phone just one week there is no problems. camera is good. sound quality is best with dolby. battery is good for normal use but in gaming is just avarege . in this price range is best 😀😂 this mobile not works as hotspot to connect pc with dongle, this is awful experience. i tried many settings but failed , i m using tp link wn-725n .its alwas shows failed to connect.camera is not good as compared to lower models. never buy online.just bought the phone on 23 january....but after the update it\\'s not even switch on....and it can\\'t even be replaced bahut hi bekar ghatiya product hai quick battery drain on standby and occasional heating issues. dual camera implementation is fine, but the overall image quality is average and could have been better. it\\'s kinda heavy but its worth the buy. good product from lenovo. with internal space and ram being addressed with this model, its more practial at this price range! one suggestion - camera could have been better.. good phonebut cast screen not available not that good as expected. the wifi is not connecting automatically.it\\'s keep on searching but no luck and you have to restart the mobile to connect the wifi.i think it\\'s major issue.the applications also loading very slowly. luv it... very nice mobile. as for now, it is working great. beautiful item... nice mobile i dont no why people gives negetive rating & reviews to thise smartphone..in thise segment k8 note is best smartphone ever... the mobile i got was having hot spot problem except this phone was good. good i have bought this phone from this seller during its september launch. now within 2 months my device screen started showing some small white lines appearing on screen from top to bottom when viewing or editing certain images or while playing games. when i contacted lenovo service center, they said it\\'s not display issue but it\\'s some manufacturing defect, so the unit should be replaced by seller. now seller won\\'t replace my device as it\\'s 2 months old... so guys it\\'s better to not buy devices online, or if you do want to buy, check your device thoroughly within 10 days or you won\\'t get replacement, especially it\\'s lenovo... friends don\\'t buy this phone.full charging down by the one hour.this is not lenovo phone .it\\'s motorola version motorola phone.i am lenovo mobile fan.i purchase 6000,6000 plus,k4 note,k6 note.but this phone is worsttttt.....please change my phone (amazon) services 9642783920 i want to k6 note 64gb 4gb poor camera .and heating .please fix it mst phone h .. yr.. i love it..redmi se bhut mst h.. very happy with this mobile. not bad but camera quality low bluetooth connectivity with any bluetooth device is too poor. contact loading is too slow and bad. video buffer at hd quality video play time. and many more... totally waste investment phone camera is ok but not bad...but battery draing fast...but worth for money.... it is not design water repellent.....more heating bhut achha phone h. it s good and fine. best smartphone and affordable pricein 4gb ram, camera are so good etc. battery backupand camera quality is poor not as per expectations.weight is more.heating issue takes place in some apps.the worst parts of the phone are poor 🔋 back up and down grade camera.weight and other things are manageable but good camera quality as well as battey back up should be there. good best phone in my budget i am happy with my new phone good phone lenovo k8 note mobile hotmobile return has anyone checked whether both rear cameras are working?for me one of the back camera was not working. . a totally awesome device, giving it 1 star less because of late delivery (more than a week) and second suggestion is include an earphone in the package... very nice good please don\\'t buy this product, its performance tooo bad. very nice... overall a great product cons are the charging issue is real even though it is a turbo charger.. apart from that a slight heating issue which is common in most of the phone.pros great camera smooth ui.. no bloatware .great camera... phone was good but heating problem.i want to purchase lgq6 but lost time i was decided to take lenovo k8. phone is good in its price range. camera, display, response of touch quality are decent. main cons you must consider while purchasing this item to decide whether or not they are tolerable are (i) no ir blaster (you can\\'t use this as remote of tv or set top box.(ii) no functioning screen cast option. (iii) few (only few) bluetooth devices unable to connect. the good device from lenovo... loved it battery drain big let down.dual camera is name sake.only positive is stock android & separate sd card slot . basically phone not worth the price .people check other options also in same price range. mobile is ok, but for good quality of camera you have to use both the rear cameras, and if u use both of them no flash option, and there are some heat problem when u use ur mobile for 1hr continuously... very good seller awesome mobile..!!! i luv it...!!! poor battery performance from day-1 campare to mi phones worst product i ever seen very nice 😊 phone is not as per the expectations...a deca core processor performance is never seen. also, fast charging is only there in words. 10% to 100% takes around 2 hrs, while the dash charging of oneplus and fast charging of oppo takes half of it...also stack os is not so good. several basic functionalities and gesture settings are missing even after software update. camera is awesome and uncomparable. very dissatisfied with the phone performance, no options for group contacts, very limited options in settings menu, theme..etc. many applications doesn\\'t responds. better the camera is not so good, batery is 4000mah but not lasting a complete day. ear phon not available in box. very poor signal strength notification light not working at all... its work only at the time of charging..i have already enable all 3 option in display setting. but its not working for miss call,email, message and whatsapp like apps.if you have any suggestion please let me know. excellent. nice product i received was physically damaged gorilla glass will not give protection even for a fall form 50 cm height. also gorilla glass alone cannot be replaced but need to replace entire display costing rs.5000. too bad experience. need to add screen guard to protect gorilla glass. the phone seems to be good, but restarts on its own. has anybody else faced this problem. i don\\'t think it is related to the hardware. mobile is heated and battery is worest rear camera quality is not good.blur image is coming.battery drains faster.plz amazon could you find solution for this problem.plz dont buy this mobile.....waste of money....amazon dont lose your pride by selling this worst products..... camera performance not satisfactory. flash not comming at right time. with depth and without depth options in camera, give almost same type of photo.battery is consumed very fastly.sound quality is good. very poor quality mobile.quickly heat when internet use.earphone also not given by company and amazon in the box.cheating with coustomer. this phone camera quality is not good and future is very poor but betery back up. is good battery backup is not so good, camera quality also not very good the phone fell from my lap for the first time and the so called gorilla glass broke into so many small pieces. i can not find the replacement screen on top of it. good don\\'t buy these product it is heating up to 45degree with in 20mins usage and the the decacore processor is not up to the mark heating up a bit. but,awesome performance phone. very bad product cheap in quality network problem no incoming calls on jio sim waste of money best phone in this price range pls improve camera quality super not best i hope you will be helpful. pros1. camera is awesome at such low price.2. battery backup is good,lasts 1 day.3. deca processor helps in multitasking.4. no hybrid sim.cons :1. heating problem. linoove k 8 is good phone charger is ovever heat and he\\'s not turbocharger excellent phone. pros :front cameraturbo chargerdesigncons:rear camerasignals problemsdual camera not working properly i used this mobile for a week , i am a hardcore fan of lenovo , i waited for a mobile with full pack features and finally found lenovo k8 , booked the phone in very first sale and got delivery by next day,this mobile have so many issues, main problems are battery backup ,cam issues , heating issues, apps are getting struck in between,network issues not getting fully signal for airtel 4g when getting full signal and good net speed in lenovo k5 . finally lenovo cheated people with k8 hated this mobile.finally don\\'t purchase this mobile and dont waste 14k .... got with lenovo k5 100 times better than lenovo k8 a value for money. over all good product at the price but lenovo should try to make another version more better otherwise hatsoff to lenovo it\\'s a good phone.....can buy it\\'s done not support cast screen gud fone but front camra is not gud it\\'s just awesome nice to use sometimes it get too heat at outdoors camera and battery backup is owsum, also charging is fast. sound quality is ok, would be better if have dual speaker. i think currently it\\'s a best phone available in this price range.. properly working, smart for downloading videos, this phone heat on light usage, turbo charging takes more than 2h, some build issues, crashed few times in one month of usage. 1)battery is draining. very fast2)network signal issues3) camera not as exepected 1. phone heats up during vr screen mode.2. dual camera fails to distinguish edges. given the product faulty memory card not detected excellent easy to handel all the things said about guerilla glass screen is fake i.e it gets scratches very frequently and it got broken as soon as it felt on the road after one month, today only i tried to use. after talking one minute it is over heated. little heating prob other wise all awsm super the best competitor of redmi note 4. overall better than it. only the issue is slight warming while using it internet. rear camera could be better. focusing issue. display is not crispy as samsung. dolby is superb. processor is better than redmi note 4. better than redmi note 4 and lenovo is a brand. better build quality. i love it. its mentioned on the details that it is 4 g phone with both the sims 4g , but not even a single sim is supporting 4not a 4g phoneg the mediatek processor which it provides is not updated, which causes it to lag.it\\'s just been two days since i\\'ve bought this phone and i\\'m already experiencing this. totally disappointed by the processor. everything else is just awesome but the processor is crap!don\\'t buy it. waste of money.this is a major issue in this phone. please do not

not as good as claimed, but serves the purpose. go for it! return my money u creepsmake ur policies betternext time i m sure to not to purchase from lenovo and amazon very good excellent phone it is very fast and runs very smooth it beats redmi note 4 which i had previously and now i am using this phone for almost 3 months and its working perfectly guys plz dnt buy this mobile , i am writing this review after 28 days of using this mobile battery drains very fast , mobile is not getting charged when it in on ,getting heated up heavily , i have to switch off the mobile to get it fully charged ,even after attaining 100 % battery goes to 88 %after 2 to 5 min after i switch on it ,i dnt know the use of dual camera in it , downloading takes much slower than my old 3g asus zenfone 5 , android 7.1 is good ,dnt waste ur hard earned money on this mobile ,cant boost this mobile so the ram gets fully occupied and this lets to hang up sometimeotherwise nothing is interesting is interesting in this mobileplease don\\'t buy this mobile pretty disappointing product. lenovo was able to generate some sort if hype successfully, touting k8 note as a music phone and dual camera phone (capable of taking bouquet snaps, like dslrs) etc. infact, features were lucrative. after 3 months usage, really unhappy about the product. in fact, within a couple of days of receipt i tried to return this piece, which amazon didn\\'t accept. so, buyers better be aware of the 10 days return acceptance claim being put forward by amazon, its not a \\'no question asked\\' return policy. i accept the phone was not faulty (technically), hence the customer support person couldn\\'t help me out perhaps (even though he agreed to initiate the return procedure prima facie). all said and done, i am still a loyal customer of amazon, only angry with lenovo and on myself, why i jumped on to purchase immediately the phone got released! shouldn\\'t have done this mistake being a gadget-geek myself... my bad :(there\\'s really no point in making an attempt to write a product review. simply put, its a mediocre product. apart from the dedicated nano sim slots + dedicated microsd memory card slot, nothing is actually likeable. only this feature is worthy mentioning, as i hate the combined sim & memory tray slots where you need to choose only 2 out of the 3 (using redmi note 4 as well, and this is something i hate about the otherwise brilliant phone). one more observation. k8 note was touted and hyped as a stock android phone. at least for me, the stock os (nougat) didn\\'t impress me. i am using 3 different custom ui layers ( miui for xiaomi, eui for my le eco max 2, touchwiz in samsung galaxy note 3) and anyday would vote for them for providing with enhanced, intelligent usability, especially miui and touchwiz. have not used oxygen-mod myself, though apparently it felt quite good. i didn\\'t find this stock android in k8 note really fast, devoid of any lag etc. from the \\'ease of usage\\' perspective, i was not at all impressed. hence, even if the custom uis have some lag/slowness and bloatwares, that\\'s the tread off i am ready to embrace any day, just for the logic and intelligence they provide with. the battery charging is not at all good.it should take 2 hrs 16 mns. to charge fully, but after a month of using it ,it\\'s taken ng up to 6 hrs to get fully charged! poor battery backup. its like 3000 mah lol. and average camera.. dual camera is crap.. overall is nice phone was good camera quality good speed also good lenovo did good job by adopting stock android. overall good package in budget smartphone section. camera is good . music lovers will love this phone bcz of dac dolby atmos. usp of this phone is dual camera on rear with which we can capture sone really good depth mode pics with bookeh effect. great phone it\\'s good.... battery consumption jyada hai superb phone it\\'s a worst mobile that i but tell now, it\\'s sound quality is very worst, it\\'s heats up very mush and in very quick manner and it\\'s battery low up very quickly.i want to back this worst mobile and i also talk to amazon person some days before and i said i will talk again but i don\\'t get time so amazon help me talk with me in this topic and in last to want say that change the mobile or give me my precious money back. poor quality... camera also not good... nice

smoothly in this phone. battery problem good enough don\\'t buy this phone because screen cast option is not working and lenovo unable to resolve this problem. phone is very heavy weight and camera quality is very poor pls did not purchased this phone decent phone in this range, i got it in 10k with discount, camera quality is fine in fact front facing camera is far better 13mp, missing vibe ui i am facing problem with this set. sometimes incoming calling become off..while network is on.so please replace it more heating problem,depth camera sucks auto switch off frequently. nice please don\\'t by that phone or any lenovo products lenovo company customer care service is very poor & worst i have spent 20000 rupees in lenovo vibe shot z90 and after 13 months i have a network problem and customer care service sad that phone cannot be repaired so i lost my 20000 rupees on lenovo company why should i go with lenovo other products are available in great customer service please don\\'t buy any lenovo product. thnks total waist of money.maine b bahut search krke lene ka mann banaya bhai log bt life m pahli baar bewkoif bana is phone ko kharid k.is phone k saath headphone h

not good mobile phone. i buy this phone. but i saw 2gb ram also use in divice. no other future in divice. no gallary. not fast charging. 100°/; charging time is 3hr. redmi note 4 is good phone then lenovo k8 note. midiatek processor is too poor. super 😎 damn good phone!! laptop is not connected through wifi hotspot....how we carry data cable everytime?? good but camera quality is not satisfied. nice very well products awesome in processing, camera is ok, sometimes heats up while charging... amazon has written 4g+4g sim support by it supports 4g on either sim & 3g on other. processer is very good. very good product. loved it....beat mobile at best price very very nice. as advertised by seller. working good. love it. battery of lenova k8 not is not good. there is also other software issue and remaining things is good. heating problem, low battery back up nice phone.. but sometimes it\\'s having some issues with charging.. but overall the phone is very nice amazon delivered before time...., battery lasted 1.5 days with internet active , gets fully charged in 45 mins, selfie camera is nice but back camera in dept mode is average but not that bad, overall performance is good in this price range and happy with it....better than other fones under 15 k can\\'t believe i got it at 10k, great phone but the chip set seems to be bit troublesome which is compensated by deca core processoronly thing that buyers still expect is confirmed updates immediately as they arrive in marketgets heated a bit while charging(common inany phones so no need to worry)everything else is just awesome i\\'am writing this review after more than a month of purchase. awesome product in this price range with overall performance and features that everyone want in their handset. actually i got that for rs11999 in offer and i love it. go for it guyzz without a second thought. dual camera is not good its fake boken mode pic is worstdon\\'t buy for camera there is no option to update a profile

product i got two piece also hanging issue, worst comar, touch not working with two days, worst customer care service experience this mobile phone is not working well it is hanging and if we switch on this phone it\\'s on off regularly i don\\'t get earephone ?how to complete i do? positive-descent look.on paper nice specifications.cost almost ok but it should be 10k.supporting both sims.separately memory card slot.negative-a lots of points- -veheats up very fast.auto shutting down and restarting frequently in a day ie normally 5 to 8 times.auto shut down and restart most negative issue.battery drains spuriously.both sim slots support volte but signal strength is very very poor.android v7.1.1 useless because it is not stable till date.totally wastage of money, rather buying k8 note go for redmi note 4 which is best mobile with lesser cost.this is huge question mark on lenevo and motorola both the brands are manufacturing together lenevo based mobiles.i m regretting after buying k8 note.pls don\\'t buy or go for another lower or upper brands.pls mind amazon too, because it makes online shopping fake by selling such stupid mobiles.now customers should wait for two sim slots and mmc cards both supporting mobiles. value for money it takes 8 hours to charge it\\'s too heats water of money return my mobile not bad... etho paravala delivered in time. best in performance screen problem basic features are missing. call forwarding, call waiting, touch keys light, etc. essentials features are not given by the company.company has to do about it by launching software version

battery backup heating problem very good product . best in use. best features good update software bug problems not bad in less than 20 days, i found my lenovo k8 note getting heated worse while charging.battery with 4000mah is a fraud, camera for night is an overrated deception, no benefit wasting money over this product. i regret not a good product. no dual apps support. no app lock facility. no quick ball. not good in features heating problem good phone network peroblam camera quality is not good. lenovo k8 plus (4gb, 64gb) mobile phone delivered is having software/hardware issue due to which is is getting hangee every now & then abruptly. re-configured this mobile phone thrice , but problem persist since delivery. kindly get this replaced with new one asap. its just another phone with upgraded ram and memory, lags at times opening some apps, sensor being at back is inconvenient, cannot cast directly to smart tv option of cast screen available but does not functions only cast you tube that also certain vedios. camera quality very poor. this smart phone is very bad in quality.it generates heat even we don\\'t perform any operation.suggest don\\'t go for this option a gud phone at this price.... very good product and service. k6 power is much batter good not recomented. battery back up is very low, less than 12 hours for normal use. amazon service also disappointing, not even approved for replacement. never and ever use amazon for buying mobiles i received the phone intact and promptly, but after few days screen broke down itself. just few days back it bcome dead. service center said all garrenty/ warrenty would be void if i donot replace the screen. they charged 5800 to replace broken screen. in summery do not go for this product. this is too good phone i\\'m using it awesome that an awesome picture lenovo k note is very smooth working phone latest android version good this is my first and last lenovo mobile. worst ever quality control. two major problems:1. screen mirroring does not work and this is for all the users who bought this mobile. a simple basic feature which would want to connect to tv.i use an amazon fire stick and it doesn\\'t work with that too.2. volte mode is not proper. jio sim works but worst ever network strength.the most irritating part being that lenovo is not providing any update for these issues. best phone for speed lovers though it is a best seller phone online it has many problems. first of all its battery life is not good and suddenly it drains to 0% . secondly camera shots are not as clear as they described in the reviews . 1) red colour is not coming proper when take photo from monitor. its look orange. also comes lining in picture from monitor.same this is better in moto g mobile.2) need back side grip finish3) need little small from height4) there is no screen guard available in market for curve lenovo5) rest goog good value for a moneycamera quality was not that much good and also brightness of screen is less comparatively to other pubg is not working properly in this mobile.it has\\'nt oreo version. it has nougat version its phone many problem performance of lenovo k8 note is good..selfi camera is quite good but volume is too low sometimes, battery back up is not that great but the processor is very strong and no headphones work on this only headphone thing is disappointing me otherwise fine wen i booked this product ,that time it showed delivery date on 20th oct 2017 but i received this parcel on 23rd oct 2017 morning .... too late delivery unhappy with performance.. battery drain quickly.. suggesting not to buy lennvo mobile heating and battery draining fastscreen rotation not working properly good product...but amazon plays by creating a fake app called blancco.. ur product will not br replaced by amazon... they just blabbers over phone call telling the document have to be made for replacement..... on my first full day use i have found battery is draining very fast. very happy phone is not good 1) gets heated fast. 2) doesn\\'t show data loading. 3) phone alarm doesn\\'t work in switch off mode. 4) there\\'s no on off option. 5) takes very much time to charge. don\\'t want to compromise for this price dose not supported volte.netwrok connection dose well. bhai yh phone thik h... pr lenovo valoo ne iski whaat lga rkhii h ... jo new update h vo bhut problem kr rha h sbhi k phone m .....bki thik h .... rate s to ........ simply super please dont bye and dont waste your money.camera is not good.i don\\'t feel dolby atomos.cheap product with high price tag. in this budget it is awesome phone. i like it. i m giving 4 star bcoz the color is not much vibrant in photos but clarity is awesome and selfie camera is very good. battery is ok. 1 day standby. the phone is superb, very reponsive and reactive screen with full hd display, awesome performance but 2nd camera which of 5mp is not at all working, i tried with depth enabled mode still this camera fails to take a picture, its a superb phone so kindly give a update so that my 2nd rear camera starts working. thank you lenovo you build a warrior phone a very affordable price. totally satisfied. i want return honest reviewgood things-dual back camera-stock android-front camera flesh-free transparent coverbad things- 1.5 gb out of 4 gb ram available for user-single speaker on bottom of phone so no use of dolby digital-turbo charging is not much efficient, it takes 1 hr to charge almost 50% camera is very poor cuxgf worth for it\\'s price range???🤔google chrome it\\'s working properly, in some applications finger print is not working properly, had just used for 2 days. it\\'s hard to focus in depth mode, shutter nice can\\'t be made silent. the sensor of camera is not good but below average, my previous htc 8 mp camera had good details and clarity. camera works poor in the low light condition. it\\'s an all rounder average phone as lenovo k8 note doesn\\'t have any speciality, it is average on everything right from the processor, camera clarity, battery life, gaming, ...etc.being an android battery is not so good, but power bank is it\\'s solution. mutli tasking , many more good features, fast prosser, touch pad is also fast, finger sensor is also fast, speaker is very nice and loud. it has cool features like for typing, fingerprint sensor, dedicated music key, camera key, selfie flash light, rear camera you have dual led flashlight,using since last 7 days , will update review after some weeks.lenovo k8 note my review (4gb ram 64gb rom)i am using this phone from last one week on the basis of my experience i would share you pros and cons of the lenovo k8 note. an average user of phone like watching videos playing games.pros:- good display clarity- typing features- dedicated music key- dedicated camera key- fingerprint sensor which is quite fast- 13 + 5 mp dual camera with dual led flash light- 13mp selfie camera with led flashlight- 4 gb ram 64 gb rom- dedicated memory slot- 4000 mah li-polymer battery🔋- good office phone- guest mode feature- many other features you can unlock- good sound quality in speakers and decently loud- you can record the calls with very good clarity of both the sides- mobiles turns off when overcharged (had just read on the internet not sure about it)- good for gaming- camera capturing in savings speed is decently good- doesn\\'t lags in office applications-has good internet speed as compared to my previous mobile- speech to text feature is also quite good, recognizes almost all words even the local language i.e hindi- have emojis and gif keypad- average graphics for the gaming part- has decent touch sensitivity and speed- live qr and barcode reader- google map does works pretty well you get a notification of trafficcons:- processor is not battery efficient- mobiles get heated up while charging, gaming and movies- overall average phone- doesn\\'t have any usp- camera sensor is very poor due to which the clarity of the photos are affected also the low light performance the gif file has also a very poor quality, my previous htc had 8 mp camera whose clarity was much better than this.- google chrome doesn\\'t works properly- compare to the size of the image from the camera the clarity is not that good- hard to focus especially in depth mode- doesn\\'t has image stabilization- gif images doesn\\'t have good quality, however the gif quality is not so bad as it appears while shooting on the screen but yes it\\'s quite dark compared to the video mode.- multiple clicks does make the phone lag a bit- can\\'t read barcode and qr code on the image you saved- depth mode in the camera doesn\\'t get a very sharp image you definitely have the edges a bit soft around you have to take couple of shots to have a very perfect photograph many times you miss the moment, especially when it comes to micro photography spr mobile it\\'s working exordinary pick performance mobile battery charge awesome best phone ever . good built quality. runs very smooth .best price n budget smart phone ever everything is good,bt video player is low quality good quality product with ever best delivery services from amazon.amazon keep it up, u r superb i wanted to love this product because of features. but finding following issues.1) i can not connect it to my macbook pro and not able to find any support regarding this.2) i can not install jio apps from app store. where as i can install jio apps on other androids phones. have these guys really screwed it up by altering android software? bluetooth is proper work no call recorder supporting excellent product. mobike design and screen is good. but front camera is 13 mega pixal in written not in performance. and men issue i get in mike or network system is not working well. when i call another end didn\\'t get my voice without speaker on.. and same sim card get full network in another mobile but didn\\'t get in this mobile. not working...charge bahut dheere ho raha h...... good looking phone before the update, this was a amazing phone but after the update, it is not that good at all.... so much heating and hang problem. i need to restart my phone atleast 4 times a day now to control the heating problem. this is not good at all awesome phone.features are good in this range.ram 4gbinternal 64 gbcamera is good awesome good mobile it has range issues....for the same place where one plus, samsung has full range it has half not good phone heat up soon and primary speaker get stop till now ,it is working like a marvellousdont know about the future ....!!!! unable to make or receive calls most of the time, even when network is sufficiently strong. whereas able to do internet at the same time.after some efforts, amazon replaced the phone. but same issue in the replacement phone(same model, lenovo k8 note) as well. finally getting its refund after many efforts and wasting lot of time.if somebody calls you, most of the time it will show your phone out of coverage, even when phone is in network. verified this by call myself from my another phone. you will always get messages of many missed calls, but very few calls.whereas, when i insert my sim in my old motorola phone, everyting works well at same location.if you are unable to make or recieve calls most of the time from a phone, then no use of talking about its other good features like camera, display, looks etc. good but battery backup to low ......... it would take more time for switch on. supper mobile mobile display glass quality not good total glass break in just mobile drop from table micromax is far better than this after usage of 10days :1. music button is not working2. battery draining

better not to buy it in first place.and amazon only conformed that they are getting multiple complaints about camera ..not sure why are they still selling this. battery problem,charging problemheating problemand also too poor amazon service very bad product. the worst camera i have ever seen. even my very old configuration mobile phone had a better camera resolution. battery draining faster. useless product. only hype has been created. battery is so poor that drains out in few hrs. charging takes 3-4 hrs though it is turbocharged.only looks are good. battery charges after 3-4 hours. there\\'s no turbo charging. camera quality very poor. other than camera, happy about everything else. gr8 buget phone i really loved itjust camera quality is low than mia1 rest its superb in all terms.. phone battery not so good as stated in by the company. touch screen not so good. sound quality is good. gaming experience could be better. good mobile, battery life is long with dual sim cards and full time internet connection!! defected piece....in terms of software and hardware botb great phone.it having all important features.relatively cheaper in price than others.working fine from the day i purchase. phone is good but network problem not good.... front camera is a problem. images came a bit unfocused. not at expected level, just an android phone no other special difference.dont buy

has lot of bugs to which lenovo don\\'t even respond. battery always getting heat up after the update. unable to turn off the mobile data which drains the data and battery in no time. there are many customer struggling because of this. don\\'t buy this phone. had to give one star as there is no option of zero or minus rating. battery got heat and drained fast and turbo charger and charging is fake ... it take to full charging about 2.30 to 3 hrs. lenovo k8 note model not good, we unable to work more than 1 hr mobile any apps because of mobile getting over heat, battery back up worst, please do not buy this item excellent for the price very bed phone suddenly my lenovo k8 note was switched off and i have tried a lot to get on but unfortunately it was not on. after i was did reboot to start. finally it was started after 4 hours.but i don\\'t know wen it will be again get off. it has a heating problem nice one......powerfull and usefull bad product...poor camera quality.installed softwares are poor.heat too much.one speaker of my ordered mobile is not working. started giving issues within 2 months very nice phone best for under 12k provide a software update to this phone heating issue are there and for camera tho make the depth mode more effective and enable the led notification for missed calls and unreaded message of whatsapp and other apps good in this budget this phone fell down not from height jst from bed and broke the screen within no time moreover for long day searched for service centre but could not find one.in aligarhthis phone stops each application u open and gives a msg that this app has been stopped . good phone. but charging takes whole lot of time and battery also drains pretty fast. very bad performance.. after 2 weeks of purchase, phone is getting turn off even if there is 100% battery and restarting after 2-3 hrs. even having speaker issues. superb product it came with old firmware and took 3 hours for update (multiple updates)thought i am upgrading my phone from lenovo note 5 to lenovo note 8 but lots of good features missing definately not worth the moneypost oreo update the phone is heating up a lot service center not having any resolution a little bit heating problem lenovo k8 note has big battery issue and over heating issue... worst phone. 4hrs battery life ,heats up,hangs, amazon tested and confirmed battery draining but not taking back as i don\\'t have it\\'s box.warning-do not buy. i had to sell and buy another phone. very easy to handle even while travelling. battery life is excellent. gets little warm when used for more than half an hour at a stretch. tough yet trendy. phone is good but has little problem with network connection also getting heat good one it is a good phone except slight heating issue and photo quality is not so good. phone heated up lightly after 15 to 20 min of use. i have purchased this phone 3 months back and was very excited when the phone arrived. honestly speaking every thing in this phone is good except the battery life. the battery really sucks. it doesn\\'t really make any difference weather the internet is on or off. the battery drains like hell even in the standby mode which is really disappointing. the battery drains very fast even when the battery saver mode is on. a 4000 mah battery should have lasted longer and lenovo could have worked in a bit better way to increase the battery power as compared to redmi note 4 which comes with a 4100 mah battery and is simply brilliant in its segment with such a lower price as compared to this phone. hope you understand this and do some thing better towards resolution. problems to attached with pc great phone no lag ...no other issue great front camera back camera is also good just depth mode need more update edges are not that sharp... great phone at these go for it the phone have some serious heating issue huge network problem n sensor r also not working properly gud bettry life n sound heating problem after 4 months of usage turbo charging is not working properly and such options are missing in this phone like wireless cast screen mode worst camera, phone heats up very quickly.hangs frequently. not worth the price & to top it all worst customer service from amazon. everything is best in this price range,so grab it. good phone. i never had the heating problems. no hang as i playing asphalt 8 and extreme. gestures are not new and nothing added. camera is excellent in sun light but poor in low light and room capture. selfie camera is good n superb. incumbent big dyjddhndjjccbnnxcnnxfj it\\'s awesome depth mode doesn\\'t works properly , battery drains faster, front cam doesn\\'t looks like 13 mp , split screen was amazing, gaming was better it could be better - company claims that rear camera is of 13 mp. but it seems like less than 5mp. after using 10-13 days i found it hangs alot while using. now i don\\'t know that should i do. i have purchased this phone because of it\\'s configuration. but it didn\\'t worked for me. don\\'t buy this product. varry bed cell phone in lenovo good rough and tough mobile ya, it\\'s a good product development by lenovo company. camera picture quality is good, it\\'s easy to handle and maintain. according to me, the speaker are has performance low. the sound is audible as lenovo k6. other than that everything performance to it\\'s best i got the mobile is good condition and has been using it and found it in good condition until the the new lenovo software update happened.the mobilewith new system update]] started restarting

budget, this one is a good option. but, camera is not that so great. but decent. no heating issues. fast charge, no hang observed. battery lasts one and half days with medium usage (no games) good deal i can say as i am also using k4 note. camera quality is not up to the mark. some apps not working well cash back hdfc bank se abhi mujhe nhi mila why?? nice product and very fast delivery beast on paper.... goat in reality. getting heat in few minutes. my device supports only internet on jio sim. for calling i have to install jio voice app. notification light also not working. after complain amazon service person tried to convince me that k8 is lte not volte. than i take a screenshot from amazon\\'s site and email them. than they agreed that k8 is volte and device have some fault. so, go for other mobile . i don\\'t receive headfone with lenovo k8 note mobile i am not satisfied your product because very poor battery backup and volte is not supported. phone is hanging frequently, getting hot, headset jack has connectivity issues just after six months. fast chargingi love lenovoso happy everything is good except display clarity and bad graphic,,,, its only hd ,, not full hd , and camera always work on ur brightness level,,,so evrytme u hv to do full brightness good product sunny works good, no heating issue, satisfied by the product,cons: no earphone supplied waste of money poorui is very bad it always crashes4gb ram only for publicitydevelopers not fixing bugsboot loop bugui is not customised for hardwarepoor updates no issues of camera or heating till a certain permissible extent. best buy in this segment. camera performance is very much higher than other phones at this price. not upto standard, k4 is much better than this since the day i received the lenovo k8 note phone the snapshot button is not working what to do? i never expect such a bad quality from such a reputed brand like lenovo, from this phone i have lost my trust and will never buy lenovo again. good worst phone...within 6 months geating problem started plus battery problem, i have to charge battery atleast 3 times in a day. i you go to service center for solution, they will just format your phone & issue doesn\\'t get resolved. awesome product i liked it, not so stylish, but good budget smartphone with extra bundled features not able to send and receive sms waste of money mobile heating so much .. camera not that much clear very low quality battery is very low, signal is not working and more... killer mobile. killed my expectations. rear dual camera useless.screen cast does not work. bugs in messaging app. only camera was better ....very bad product . after few days charging was slow ,is tooks around 6 to 7 hours . and when calling someone it is over heat ....and also when playing any video screen was flashing.amazon was refunded my amount thanks for that..... no comments mobile is working good☺️☺️👌🏻 best phone bluetooth is not working properly!!! stock android software on this phone is really bad. absolutely no functionality at all. also no back-lit home buttons. what are you guys thinking. i had to return this phone due to bad software.. hardware has no use if software is bad..correct your software by adding appropriate user interface.. and back-lit buttons. phone is working fine. processor and battery performances are very good. connectivity is also cool. only concern is with over heating, set is getting hot after 30 mins of continuous use. the heating problem needs be addressed to make the set a perfect one. this product is utter waste..touch is not satisfactory..many options are unavailable..it\\'s not worthy for it\\'s price just average productnothing specialnot happy with this phone nice phones seems to be ok. but battery is very poor. drains on its own. mi is far better compared to lenovo k8. never buy this phone.it\\'s a loss if you buy. i returned in few days and amazon return policy is also not good. they will assign some person to check who will take his own time and amazon will not refund, they will replace the phone with another phone with same troubles. later i requested for refund. it\\'s a huge process. flipkart is very simple. net work signal have ful but is\\'t not work and not set to custom ring tone ,totally very very poor missed call & message coming after notification light not glowing how to solve this problem excellent product😄 this set is having problem ...need help bad low light camera quality is too poor screenshot icon not mentioned this mobile and all futures not mentioned this mobile amazing product...no heating issue...battery could have stayed a lil longer for the 4000mah description. great features and looks good too. headsets are not provided in the box. it\\'s very nice k8(4gb, 64gb) mobile, all features are awesome. i have received it on 14.09.17 as promised. only the issue of battery life is matter of concern. today updated by lenovo regarding these issues, let\\'s see. but overall good choice. good phone around 10k for all round performance wort product got a damaged one. has some issue with network.. amazon service was not good. dnt buy this product. *4.5 stars*i received this phone on 22/03/2018.i did a lot of research before buying this and the issue which most of the people were having were:overheatinglow battery optimizationdepth mode etc...so first of all... i\\'m an average person with quite a bit of knowledge of smartphone specs...i found this smartphone to be great according to myself.overheating was not an issue to me. even though i\\'m bit of a gamer and i do play heavy games often. surely the phone does heat a bit but not as much as i\\'d have to stop using it or playing games on itbattery is a great deal for me...i tend to spend most of time on my phone but then also i think battery is very powerful...and for surfing sites n apps the battery won\\'t drop a single percent for about 20 mins....and the turbo charger is just awesome...it charges so quickly that you just can\\'t argue...lastly the camerawell i\\'m someone who never owned a phone with dual camera before...so i liked it pretty much.its not a problem for me. so if you are someone who only had single camera phone till now then this k8 note camera is great for you...but if you have owned such earlier then i don\\'t know what to compare it with.i hope this helps! good phone very good product dint like .. wish to return but its nt returnable the phone came in due time. apart from the said bokeh affect from the dual cameras,the performance is cool. good battery life, stock android with nougat and priority based updates from google. all in all a good buy in 14k (probably most suitable in this price range) the phone have multiple fuction under such price good product excellent product manufactured by lenovo it\\'s owesome . its one speaker is not working first of all i wd say the phn is overvalued considering its price to features parameter....sound...display.... touch effects all needs much improvements...then there is hanging issues.... eg..dolby feature gets hanged often...camera rear doesn\\'t give u expected pic clarity though depth effect is present in its dual rear interface....all in all disappointed ...although i was expecting reasonable better features for a 12 - 13 k...device taking lenovo into consideration... it\\'s been over 6 months. haven\\'t faced any problem till this date;good for gaming;fast charging;very good photo quality. phone is working very slow, really worst product. there is headset in the box. everything good except for the heating and battery (fast drainage and slow recharge compared to my previous mi) superb phone, value for money.. good but note best lenovo k8 note is a good device but it\\'s not a perfect one.the first problem which i faced is it\\'s overheating and it\\'s ram management.hardly 2gb is available for our usage.but the main attraction of this phone is it\\'s camera. it\\'s a great phone, the music is awesome in headphones for this price. it\\'s a very premium phone with looks, feel and usage , it\\'s fluid to use. the phone gets little hot but not that much it\\'s during charging and heavy usage. i will definitely recommend this phone who looks a great phone for low cost or any one who looks a great phone. battery draining very fastly. charging taking for long time. poor product phone is awesome..but yeah it overheats..idk why?but mine is heating fast.. over all it\\'s all good...loved it.. good product fantastic product and awesome service provide by amazon. thanks to amazon for fast delivery . device is very good and works fluently . nice mobile ..good photo clearity some features of k4 note is much better than k8 note e.g. auto call recording, wide touch, call received by sensor, speed dialing, theater max sound ,nfc , notification center, net speedometer , percentage of battery shown in notification etc. are not given in k8 note. try to solve these problems. thanks good 📞 good life. nice product with good specifications.4/64 with dedicated slot.10 cores, camera with front flash is awesome.but cannot zoom camera excellent feature phone it is the best phone.and it\\'s camera is so wonderful.. nice phone.. turbo charging is not working.it takes to much time to charge the phone. nice phone but some battery issues guys am just loving this device....it\\'s display is so cool. and cameras they are awesome at this price. you can do a slow motion, peranoma etc with those rear cameras. was using lenovo k5 note now upgraded to this one. it\\'s way to better. go for it guys. 4gbram with 64gb internal makes it a beast its not a 4g lte connectedit was not good very bad😈😈😈😈😈 camera is ok ok other wise a great phone this phone has many good features like customizable music key, front flash, excellent battery, separate sim tray and sd card tray etc but it\\'s rear camera is not good at all. it takes videos at 30 fps, it\\'s color range is not so wide and it has only 4x zoom whereas many phones in the same range offer both 120 fps and 8x zoom. lenovo k8 note bill charging backup is fine.... heating issue is there.... product is good this phone is very bad phone for battery lifebattery life is very poor nd phone is heating battery draining fast rest of them is good phone signal sim not working properly.battery charging very poor iam lose 11,999 very nice phone. awesome phone surprised package phone is good but battery%ate low excellent product but bit big phone is nice but the battery is very weak not working half a day battery drains too fast because of software update... otherwise a better update in software will make it ohk.. best camera.. best sound quality.. superb phone never hangs.. good mobile with awesome camera and easy to access the features... good phone this phone is performance poor and hungin phone mobile is good but they are claiming for turbo charger, i don\\'t think so because it\\'s taking almost 3 hrs for full charge. batter good nice phone but there r some issues1 heats very fast2 dual cam just a gimmickotherwise nice it will never heat if maintain properly..this phone is superb you must buy this and it is better than moto g5s,mi4 and mia1 i got today lenova k8 note its over all mind blowing music very goodgood phone this budget and future very good worst phone.. don\\'t spend hard earn money on such phone.. chor hai amazon wale maine 19 october ko complain kiya tha lenovo k8 note k liye or pickup hua 15 november ko or refund

face unlock and great cameras front and back. using it without any hitches excellent product - very happy with the phone nyc products processor is slow and it hangs all the time with very poor battery backup. very bad mobile....waste of money.......bad camera......waste processer .....hanging problem......singal receiver is very poor...dual camera.....is waste.....it is only for photos....video is not possible....and blur is also poor.....camera quality is poor.....my suggestion is don\\'t buy.....this is really poor....heating problem....and battery backup is poor..... it\\'s a good mobile in all the aspects..you may find little difficulty to adopt to stock android.turbo charger is good everything is ok like battery backup, camera ,ram rom but problem with signal intensity it\\'s so weak great phone.but sound quality is way too low as compared to k4 note. dont buy lenovo k8 note worst mobile i bought this mobile 6 months back now charging cable is not working phone is over heating my first expression was oh , it\\'s killer note . when i turn on the phone i was just shocked because it also contain microsoft apps like exel, power point , etc .then i moved to camera phone\\'s focus was amazing . love the killer8 note good but isme kuch featured nhi he my new k8 note first impression is very bad.all is good but the overheating problem is start in first day.its heating when i talk,internet browsing or more. good i am facing problem when incoming calls no numbers and no name show on off screen only ring come. i cant takcall without open fone and screen slide lower side than i can talk waste of buying this mobilemobile getting over heating. very slow charging. mobile is very worst and customer support very very worst, pls return this product. worth your money. i am facing problem with network connection.when we call although the phone is receiving the connection still it replies that the phone is swithched off.there is always a network problem in the phone. network singles are never too full. therefore, this phone should be replaced. nice phone not so good. very poour battery parformance and prosecer i really like the phone, everything is working fine whater i use on the phone. the lenovo k8 note is awesome. it takes best pictures with dual camera. very slim and metallic body which is a bit difficult to hold on hand, back cover is must. features are awesome with android. battery is a bit concern if you are regular user. awesome gaget.. @ this price this phone is nice processing will be successful but dual camera is not be successfully in dual mod good product but the pakeging was not enough.'"
